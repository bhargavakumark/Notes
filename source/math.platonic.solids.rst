platonic solids
---------------
There are only 5 3-d symmetric figures

*    **Cube**
*    **Tetrahedron** - a 3d figure. with four sides as triangles. Similar to pyramid except the base is also a triangle
*    **Octahedron** - 8 triangle faces. Joining two pyramids gives a octahedron.
*    **Do-decahedron** - 12 pentagon sides.
*    **Icosohedron** - 20 triangular faces.

It is not possible to have anymore other than these.

In a triangle each angle is 60 degrees, so at a vertex we can have 3x60 4x60 5x60 angle being formed which result in tetrahedron, octahedron icosohedron respectively.

In a rectangle each angle is 90 degress, so at a vertex we can have 3x90 which result in cube.

In a pentagon each angle is 105 degrees, so at a vertex we can have 3x105 which result in do-decahedron.

In a hexagon each angle is 120 degrees, so at a vertex having 3x120 results in a flat plane.

Hence we cannot have any more symmetric solids other than these.

Duality
-------
An Octahedron can be created by joining the midpoints the sides of a cube. This property is called duality. Octahedron is dual of cube. Icosohedron is dual of do-decahedron. A Tetrahedron is self-dual
