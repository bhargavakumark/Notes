Fermat's Theorem
================

Generating Pythageron Triples

s\ :sup:`2`\ +t\ :sup:`2`\ 

s\ :sup:`2`\ -t\ :sup:`2`\ 

Fermat's Theorem
----------------
x\ :sup:`n`\ +y\ :sup:`n`\ =z\ :sup:`n`\  does not exist for n > 2

Proof of the theorem for n = 4
------------------------------

x\ :sup:`4`\  + y\ :sup:`4`\  = z\ :sup:`2`\ 

(x\ :sup:`2`\ )\ :sup:`2`\  + (y\ :sup:`2`\ )\ :sup:`2`\  = z\ :sup:`2`\ 

x\ :sup:`2`\  = 2st y\ :sup:`2`\  = s\ :sup:`2`\ - t\ :sup:`2`\  z = s\ :sup:`2`\  + t\ :sup:`2`\ 

s\ :sup:`2`\  = y\ :sup:`2`\  + t\ :sup:`2`\ 

s = u\ :sup:`2`\  + v\ :sup:`2`\  y = u\ :sup:`2`\  - v\ :sup:`2`\  t = 2uv

x\ :sup:`2`\  = 4suv

s, u, v do not have any common factors
s u v are perfect squares

s = e\ :sup:`2`\  u = f\ :sup:`2`\  v = g\ :sup:`2`\ 

e\ :sup:`4`\  = f\ :sup:`4`\  + g\ :sup:`4`\ 

We have proven that thare are 3 other numbers e,f,g which can again follow this property, and since that can't go on this forever, this assumption invalied
