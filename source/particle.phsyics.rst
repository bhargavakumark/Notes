Classical idea of physics
-------------------------

Clasical ideas define gravity and other things. These laws hold in the world with objects of bigger size. With tiny objects such as electrons the classical laws of physics fail.

*    **Mass is Conserved**: E = mc2. So mass can be created or destroyed if equivalent energy is created or destroyed.
*    **Gravity**: Newton simply thought that gravity was another force and that two masses have some mysterious force pulling them together. Einstein thought otherwise; he believed that mass curves the space arround it and because of this curvature in space, objects are "attracted" to each other.


Initial theory of Particle Physics
----------------------------------
All objects are made of fundamental constiuents electrons, protons and neutrons. All atoms area of the same size, but nucleus are of different size. Atoms cannot be seen by eye, because the the size of atoms is less than wavelength of light.

Also called **high energy physics**

Leptons
-------
Leptons are a class of partciles which are very light such as electrons, neutrions, muions. Muion is a heavier version of electron.

Force carrying particles
------------------------
Same charges repel each other. An electron repels an electron. An electron creates a force carrying patricle and sends it to the other electron, which recoils and moves away due to the force of the transferred particle. The 2nd electron alos does the same thing repelling the first electron. These force particles are \Bphotons\B

Dalton's theory
---------------
Dalton measured various chemical reactions, and observed the weight is always conserved. That is the same number of say carbon atoms and nitrogen atoms comes out of chemical reactions which weigh some number of units.

Dimitriv Mendelev's periodic table
----------------------------------
Dimitriv based on dalton's theory starting calculating various kind of atoms present in the world. His theory stated that chemical reactions are just exchange of atoms from one compound into another compound.

Dimitriv created the periodic based upon his measurements of weights of atoms. He organised these atoms based upon the properties of the atoms.

Brownian Motion
---------------
A dust particle of pollen when put in a fluid, the little particle would jiggle around moved in either direction randomly. Einstien's theory is the little particle is being hit by atoms from both sides, when the force one side is greater than other side the particle moves that side.

Radioactivity
-------------
Energy coming out of elements without any reaction. Common Radiation is

*    Alpha radiation +vely charged, proton beam
*    Beta radiation (cathode rays) -vely charged, electron beam
*    Gamma radiation (X-rays), bones absord X-rays, neutron beam


Plank's theory
--------------
Plank analysed how elements emit light when heated. When you jiggle a charge a little elecromagnetic wave which travel away which is called light a wave. Light was understood to be wave. According to plank light is emitted in quantums of light, which is in agreement with the data.

Einstein's papers
-----------------
Einstein after completing his Phd worked in a patent office, durin which time he published 3 papers.

*    Brownian Motion, qunatitive demonstration of atoms are real
*    Special Theory of relativity
*    Photo-electric effect, when light hits metal electricity is produced. 


Neil Bohr's theory
------------------
Electron orbit is made up of qunatums. Electron is wave-particle duality. Electron is both wave and particle at the same time.

Schrodinger's equation
----------------------
Its a equation which can be solved to find electron properties like energy.

Max born
--------
Electron is travelling in a wave, but the equation explains where the electron is likely to be found and where it is not likely to be not found.

Heisenberg' uncertainity principle
----------------------------------
Its a forumula which says if you have information about one thing then you lose information about another thing.

Paul DeRac Qunatum Electro-dynamics QED
---------------------------------------
DeRac QED is consistent with quantum mechanics and theory of relativity. Electron is a point like object. Even thoudh its a point it has a mass, charge and spin.

Anti-Matter
-----------
Same mass and spin but different charge. Electron anit-matter is positron. When matter and anti-matter meet they annilate each other.

Yukawa's theory
---------------
Yukawa described the strong nuclear force inside the nucleus. Similar to electron which produces a photon and sends it to the other electron which causes both of them to repel each other, protons also produce some particles. Strong nuclear forces is atleast 1000 times stronger than electric force. Strong nuclear force is made up of particle which is massive. The way this particle is created by following heisenberg uncertainity principle which allows to use energy around for a very small amount of time and create a particle and use it as force carrier. The principle also explains how much amount of energy can be borrowed and for how long. These particles are called mesons. This force increase with lesser distance as the time to travel for the meson is smaller it can be more heavier. These type os mesons are callee pions, there also other types of mesons (vritual particles).

Natural Radiation
-----------------
From the sky called cosmic radiation from stars and sun. Mostly of high energy protons.

Ion trails
----------
When radiation like alpha or beta rays which are charged when hits matter repels the electric charge in atom. As the rays pass through the matter it leaves an ion trail, which have either more postive or negavtive charge.

Particle Accelarators
---------------------
Particle accelarators are apparatus which can detect the charge particle beam. When a photographic plate is exposed to charged particle beam it will leave a ion trail in the plate. The intensity of the trail can be used to find out properties about the particle beam. Highly charged particly would leave thicker beam.

*    **Cloud chamber** - a chamber closed with piston and containing gas. When the piston is released the gas expands and expanded gas likes to condense. When this condensed gas is exposed to ion trail it would leave a trail of water droplets. Even though the ion trail is microscopic the water droplet trail is visible. The cloud chamber is 3d when compared to photographic plate which is 2d.
*    **Bubble chamber** - similar principle to cloud chamber but uses superheated water

The density of water droplets describes the properties of charged particle bream. This when combined with magnetic field, which can be used to deflect the charged beam helps to find more properties. Stronger beam would bend less.

Faraday
-------
Faraday proposed that space between the nucleus and the electron is not empty, but is filled with electro-magnetic field. This field is a source of energy and can be used to borrow energy to create particle an anti-particle. Therefore an atom is composed of electron, proton and a electric field which can produce different number of particle and anti-particle pairs. These virtual particles are called vaccum fluctuations.

feinman's diagrams

Gellman's model
---------------
Proton is made of quarks. There were 3 types of quarks in this model called up,down and strange. A particle can be made up of different combination of these quarks. According to this model a meson is quark and anti-quark. Yukawa's pion is an up-quark and anti-down-quark. Corks are described as point like particle like electrons.

In this model a proton is up,up and down quark combination. Each of these quark has a particular spin. up has 1/2 spin, down has -1/2 spin, so a proton has a 1/2 spin. up and down quark weight about 1/3 unit. A neutron is made up of one up quark and 2 down quarks. An up quark has charge +2/3 and down has -1/3.

Gellman proposed a strangeness number. A berion is up,down and strange, has a strangeness 1. Strange particle is a little heavier than up/down quark. A strange,strange,strange particle is called omega. A strange particle has the same charge as down quark.

Delta particle
--------------
A delta particle is a little heavier than proton, and very quickly decays into a proton. A delta particle is made up of up,up,up quarks.

Colour property
---------------
An up quark with the same spin cannot be kept with an up quark of the same spin. So if a particle with 3 up quarks exist, then they need to have some property which has different values. This colour property is the charge of the quark which helps the quarks to stick together called colour charge. The colour force is the force that arises when two colour charges gets close together.

So a object with quarks of 3 differnet colours is colour neutrual. Protons and neutrons are colour neutral. Even though the protons and neutrons are colour neutral the colour is distributed in the proton. When the protons are far apart the effect of distributedness is low and hence they do not experience cloour force. When the protons comes close the distributedness of the colour charge comes into effect and both protons attrct towards each other.

A meson is made up of quark of one colour and anit-quark with anti-colour.

Quantum chrom-dynamics - QCD
----------------------------
Quantum field of colours. When a colour field around a coloured object is jiggled it creates glueons and anti-glueons. Unlike photons, mesons which are electrically neutral, glueons are not colour neutral. Glueons have colour charge and hence the field around a glueon is charged. Glueons travelling from the one colour charge to another can interact with other glueons, hence the colour force is a lot more stronger than electric force. The force gets stronger by time. When we try to pull two colour charges away the glueon force gets strouger and grows with distance. If we try pullout a quark the colour force gets stronger and stronger and it is impossible to pull out a quark out of a proton, that is why we donot find an individual quark. We can only find a colour neutral particle, a particle with 3 quarks and colour neutral such as neutrons and protons, a particle with 2 quarks with colour and anti-colour. We cannot find a non-colour neutral particle in lab.

Weak force Particles
--------------------
Weak force carriers are called w+ and w- particles and 'z' particles. The w particle is incredibly massive, hence can only be borrowed for a extraordinary short time. The mass of a w boson is around 80 times that of a proton.

Neutrino
--------
Neutrino has no electric charge, no mass. It can only be emitted or absorbed by w bosons, i.e a neutrino can only interact with weak force. They have spin 1/2. A neutrino produced by beta decay is an electron-flavoured neutrino. When this neutrino interacts with the nucleus then it is likely to produce electron, it will never produce a muion. When a muion decays to produce electron, it also produces muion-flavoured neutrino and an electron-flavoured neutrino. Every nulcear reaction in the sun produces a neutrino.

Beta decay
----------
A neutron converting into a proton and electron. Beta decay produces another particle neutrino.

Strangeness
-----------
Strangeness is preserved during strong force interactions but not during weak force interactions.

Electro-weak force theory
-------------------------
At higher energies weak forces get stronger. Weak force is similar to electro-magnetic forces. The mass of the z and w particle from this theory.

Higg's particle
---------------
The higg's field is everywhere. Every fundamental particle interacts with it.

Gauge symmetry
--------------

CP-violation
------------
Breaking of symmetry between matter and anti-matter. Weak interaction violates symmetry. Decay is not symmetry. A particle could decay into fundamental particles which conserve quantum numbers. It has been observed during decay the same number of particle and anti-particles are not observed. Matter is more common in nature than anti-matter. If the nature is made up of same amount of matter and anti-matter they would annihilate each other, and the world would be empty.

Super Symmetry
--------------
Super partner of a particle have the same values for all qunatum numbers except spin. The spin of super partner is different.

String theory
-------------
The world is made up of lines(strings). String is the only fundamental particle in the world.
